"Landfills are breeding grounds for anaerobic bacteria, producing large amounts of methane. Methane has a stronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide; although it can be captured and converted into energy, even the most efficient recovery systems still allow up to 10% of the methane to escape. Since most of the methane produced in landfills comes from organic waste, it can be handled in a greener way, with composting being the simplest method. In fact, two-thirds of the waste in landfills could be composted, significantly reducing methane production. Because high temperature and pressure are generated during the composting process, some of the carbon in the organic waste may convert to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Therefore, we could consider recombining these organic materials into liquid fuels (ethanol or methanol), or using them as raw materials for other industrial purposes.

The claim that a person's achievements and success in life depend mainly on emotional intelligence has become so widespread as to raise doubts.

"Star formation requires gas.  In star clusters, a large amount of gas is often dissipated early in the cluster's formation, leading to the long-held belief that star clusters could not form new stars. Only collisions or mergers between stars could potentially replenish old stars with new fuel, making them appear younger than the other stars. Stars formed through collisions or mergers are known as blue stragglers; their name comes from their distinctly different evolutionary path compared to the vast majority of stars, causing them to fall outside the evolutionary trajectories predicted by theory. A research team used observational data to study blue stragglers in the young star cluster NGC2173, observing for the first time an unusual group of blue stragglers within this young star cluster. According to their findings, this star cluster contains blue stragglers which were formed in a sudden burst.

"Cultural evolution has its own inherent laws. If we do not respect these natural laws of cultural development, the so-called construction of culture may turn into damage to culture. Take as an example the current widespread call for the revival of traditional Chinese learning (Guoxue). According to scholars' research, there were three periods in Chinese history when Guoxue flourished most: the Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period, the Wei-Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties Period, and the late Qing Dynasty to early Republican era. These three periods share a common characteristic—the collapse of authority and the breaking of ideological constraints, leading to a brilliant burst of creativity. Culture needs prosperity and development, but how to provide a more relaxed environment for cultural development and how to further emancipate the mind are perhaps issues that all sectors of society need to jointly consider and study.

Answer:  
Scientists conducted an 8-week experiment: three groups of experimental mice were exposed to 16 hours of light during the day, then placed in complete darkness, dim light, and lit environments respectively for 8 hours at night, repeating daily. During the experiment, all mice received exactly the same type and amount of food. The results showed that mice kept in dim light or lit environments at night gained more weight.

"Why does a dog hide its muzzle under its front legs when sleeping, while a cat hides its ears under its front legs when sleeping? Animals use their sensory organs to detect changes in the surrounding environment and respond differently to various changes. Dogs have an especially sensitive sense of smell; they rely on smell to identify objects, and military dogs even use their noses to detect enemies and recognize paths. For dogs, their noses are most precious, so when sleeping, they hide their muzzle and nose under their front legs for protection, while staying alert to surrounding sounds with their nose. If any situation arises, they can immediately identify it using their nose or bark loudly to show aggression.

Cats have particularly sensitive hearing; they use their hearing to detect environmental changes. When hunting mice, cats rely on their hearing to locate the mice. For cats, their ears are most precious, so when sleeping, they tuck their ears under their front legs—to protect their ears and press them against the ground simultaneously. Once they hear any sound, they can take immediate action. After entering human households, both cats and dogs have continued to maintain these sleeping postures.

"The data monopoly of artificial intelligence presents new practical challenges for antitrust theory. In other words, theoretical innovation in antitrust law is a realistic and practical necessity. Specifically, the demand for theoretical innovation in antitrust law mainly includes the following aspects: First, the two-sided market theory. Compared with one-sided markets, the two-sided market theory proposed by economists can provide useful insights for antitrust enforcement in multi-sided data markets. Current two-sided market theory on one hand needs further improvement by paying attention to practical developments, and on the other hand requires exploration into how it can be transformed into applicable and operational antitrust laws and regulations. Second, the relevant market theory. Data antitrust in AI necessitates discussion on the necessity and feasibility of separately defining a ""data market,"" and also calls for recognition of the inadequacy of traditional relevant market definition tools in the data market, thereby actively exploring alternative analytical tools.

"The transformation of the connotation of the principal contradiction in society is manifested by gradual changes in the structures of both the supply and demand sides. In fact, when the central government proposed a few years ago that China had entered a new normal of development, followed by the proposal of structural reform on the supply side, it indicated an awareness of the change in the connotation of the principal contradiction in society, although this awareness did not go beyond the overall framework of supply failing to meet demand. Moreover, we should recognize that the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China spoke about the transformation of the principal contradiction, and the principal contradictions before and after the transformation are not mutually exclusive or opposed. The contradiction between ""the people's ever-growing needs for a better life"" and ""unbalanced and inadequate development"" represents an expansion and elevation of the original principal contradiction: ""backward production"" has been upgraded to ""unbalanced and inadequate development,"" and ""the people's ever-growing material and cultural needs"" have been elevated to ""the people's ever-growing needs for a better life.""
