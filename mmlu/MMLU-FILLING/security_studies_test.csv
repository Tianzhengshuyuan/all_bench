126,"During the 20th century, how has the focus of security studies changed regarding military security?","Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security.","Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.","Prior to the Cold War the focus of security studies lay in the military sector, although environmental security was rapidly emerging as a serious threat to security, forcing analysts to reconsider the state-centric frameworks they had previously employed.","During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector. Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security.",在整个20世纪，安全研究的重点在军事安全方面发生了怎样的变化？,安全研究在考虑安全领域时一直偏爱广泛的主题。各种类型的安全，尤其是人类安全和经济安全，在传统安全研究中与军事安全一起受到了广泛关注。冷战结束后，这种方法进一步扩展，涵盖了诸如环境安全和个人安全等其他类型的安全。,自冷战以来，军事安全已成为安全分析中的主导领域；学者和从业者都认识到追求军事安全的至高重要性，这种观点基于军事能力对人类和国家生存构成最大威胁的认识。,冷战之前，安全研究的重点是在军事领域，尽管环境安全正迅速成为对安全的严重威胁，迫使分析人士重新考虑他们以前采用的以国家为中心的框架。,在冷战期间，大多数安全分析人士认为军事安全应该是安全研究的重点；因此，除了军事领域之外，对于安全所包含的内容并没有太多的讨论。在此之后，安全研究的范围得到了扩展，涵盖了我们今天所看到的更广泛的领域，包括环境安全和政治安全。,D
55,Which of the following are true of the Great Law of Peace of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy?,The Great Law alerts scholars to the problem of failing to sustain critique.,The case of the Great Law illustrates the importance of being critical of practices of research and knowledge production.,"The Great Law is a challenge for traditional security studies, as it represents a proven non-state approach.",All of these.,以下哪项关于豪德诺索尼联盟的《和平大法》是正确的？,《和平大法》提醒学者注意未能持续进行批判的问题。,《和平大法》这一案例说明了对研究和知识生产实践保持批判的重要性。,《和平大法》对传统安全研究构成挑战，因为它代表了一种已被证实的非国家方法。,以上所有选项。,D
160,Which of the following are trends to emerge in the global defence trade since the end of the Cold War?,"A growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially of WMDs.",A growth in volume of the arms trade.,"A change in the nature of the defence trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict.",All of these options.,以下哪项是冷战结束以来全球国防贸易中出现的趋势？,各国政府日益努力防止武器扩散，尤其是大规模杀伤性武器的扩散。,军火贸易数量的增长。,国防贸易性质的变化，与冲突性质的变化相关。,所有以上选项。,D
138,Which of these best describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity?,The inherent promotion of feminine characteristics in society.,Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.,All of these options.,The acknowledgement that gender identity exists in many forms and is not binary.,以下哪一项最能描述霸权性男性气质的概念？,社会对女性特征的内在推崇。,由于“男性”特征被认为比“女性”特征更有价值，从而导致男性在社会中对女性的支配地位。,所有以上选项。,承认性别认同存在多种形式，并非仅限于二元划分。,B
203,How might the diversity of the current global international system impact upon the case for humanitarian intervention?,"The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity.","Despite the inclusion of a diverse range of political actors, whose cultural, ethical and religious values are often at odds with one another, there exists a general consensus amongst all states that humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified.","The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.","Within the contemporary global arena there are a number of radically different views on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exists a need for unifying principles of humanitarian intervention.",当前全球国际体系的多样性可能如何影响人道主义干预的正当性？,全球政治舞台被一种人类安全范式所主导，这种范式以什么是安全的核心假设为基础，提倡人类安全，并超越了文化和政治的差异。,尽管参与的各国政治行为体常常在文化、伦理和宗教价值观上相互冲突，但所有国家之间仍然存在一种普遍的共识，即认为有时进行人道主义干预是正当的。,在文化、政治、意识形态和宗教价值方面各不相同的国家，导致了全球体系中各国在应该如何治理自身及彼此关系的问题上存在根本性的分歧。为了保护这种多样性，存在一些禁止干涉主权国家（如进行人道主义干预）的交战规则。,在当代全球舞台上，对于国家应该如何治理自身及彼此关系存在许多截然不同的观点。为了保护这种多样性，需要制定统一的人道主义干预原则。,C
206,"According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, in what ways does the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differ from that of Critical Security Studies?","The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.","Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.","Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.",Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.,根据布赞（Buzan）、怀弗（Waever）和德·维尔德（de Wilde）的观点，哥本哈根学派的安全研究方法在哪些方面不同于批判安全研究？,支撑每种方法的理论和知识从根本上是相互对立的。尽管批判安全研究是后结构主义和建构主义的，但哥本哈根学派则基于客观主义的认识论。,尽管批判安全研究认为安全是一种社会建构，其基础是构成人类社会的可变观念，但哥本哈根学派却摒弃了这种认识论方法，并转而从实证主义的角度将安全视为一个可以客观研究的问题。,批判安全研究认为安全是一种可以通过经验定义的状态，应该从实证主义的角度进行研究。然而，哥本哈根学派则将安全视为一种社会建构的实体，并否定客观研究方法的有效性。,批判安全研究和哥本哈根学派都没有考虑到社会不断变化的本质及其对安全建构的影响。,A

242,What are the challenges for the future of security studies?,"The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.",The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.,"Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order. This picture shows that there will be a lot of points of contact between the currently disconnected fields of theory.",All of these options.,安全研究的未来面临哪些挑战？,2000年代最明显的共同关注问题是恐怖主义与秩序，尽管对环境/气候安全的迅速增长的担忧很容易成为另一个重要的关联议题。,安全研究的命运取决于其在国际关系（IR）学科的一般辩论中占据主导地位的能力。当前理论争论中的内部动态很不可能由某一个现有辩论的普遍胜利来决定。,美国和欧洲的分析家都将致力于研究技术的作用与性质、全球化、风险社会以及国际经济秩序。这表明目前脱节的各个理论领域之间将存在大量接触点。,所有以上选项。,D
201,What is the relationship between culture and social constructivism?,All of the below.,"Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.","Social constructivism does not regard culture as being an important feature to study, instead focusing on individualistic aspects of identity such as personal interests and ambition.",Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity.,文化和社会建构主义之间有什么关系？,以下所有选项。,文化是共同身份和互动的产物，尽管它在理解社会身份动态方面很重要，但其更广泛地运用于安全研究则存在很大争议。,社会建构主义并不认为文化是研究的重要特征，而是关注身份的个人主义方面，如个人兴趣和抱负。,文化通常被视为一套赋予共同经验和行为以意义的实践；它可能影响国家如何看待安全问题，并且对于构建身份的价值观和规则至关重要。,D
