79,"The hit ratio of a cache memory is the percentage of accesses (reads and writes) for which data are found in the cache. Write-through is a policy whereby every write operation updates main memory. Write-back is a policy whereby a write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Write-allocation is a policy whereby a cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss. If it is assumed that write-allocation is always used, which of the following is true?",Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.,Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.,The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.,The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for writethrough than for write-back.,高速缓存的命中率是指在所有访问（读和写）操作中，数据能够在缓存中找到的百分比。写直达（Write-through）是一种策略，即每次写操作都会更新主存。写回（Write-back）是一种策略，即当对缓存中已存在的行进行写操作时，不会立即更新主存，而是等到该行被从缓存中替换出去时才更新主存。写分配（Write-allocation）是一种策略，即当发生写缺失时，会为该数据分配并加载一个缓存行。假设总是使用写分配，那么以下哪一项是正确的？,Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.,Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.,The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.,The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for writethrough than for write-back.,C

25,"Consider a computer system in which processes can request and release one or more resources. Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released.
