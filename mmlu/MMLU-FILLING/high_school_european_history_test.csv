From this moment until that in which the enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the service of the armies. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. …
The Committee of Public Safety is charged to take all necessary measures to set up without delay an extraordinary manufacture of arms of every sort which corresponds with the ardor and energy of the French people. It is, accordingly, authorized to form all the establishments, factories, workshops, and mills which shall be deemed necessary for the carrying on of these works, as well as to put in requisition, within the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workingmen who can contribute to their success.
The representatives of the people sent out for the execution of the present law shall have the same authority in their respective districts, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the unlimited powers assigned to the representatives of the people to the armies.

公共安全委员会负责采取一切必要措施，立即建立一个能够反映法国人民热情和活力的特殊武器制造体系。因此，它有权设立一切被认为对完成这些工作必要的机构、工厂、作坊和磨坊，并在全国范围内征调能够促进这些工作成功的艺术家和工人。

Read the following memoir.
Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: ""I do not know him""; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, ""He is a man I never see""; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.

他不仅期望所有有身份地位的人都要不断地在宫廷中侍奉，而且对于那些地位较低者的缺席也很快就会注意到；在他的起床仪式、他的睡榻、他的用餐时，在凡尔赛宫的花园里（这是朝臣们通常被允许跟随他的唯一地方），他总是左右巡视；没有什么能逃过他的眼睛；他能注意到每一个人。如果有人长期居住在宫廷却缺席，他一定要知道原因；那些仅为短暂停留而来到宫廷的人也必须给出令人满意的解释；那些很少或从未露面的人肯定会引起他的不悦。如果有人请求他赐予这种人恩惠，他会高傲地回答：“我不认识他”；对于那些很少出现的人，他会说：“我从没见过这个人”；而这些裁决是无法更改的。  
没有人比路易十四更懂得如何通过赐予恩惠的方式而增加恩惠的价值；他懂得如何充分利用一个词、一个微笑，甚至一个眼神。  
他热爱辉煌、宏伟和奢华的一切事物，并在宫廷中鼓励这种品味；在马车和建筑、宴饮和玩牌上自由地花钱，是赢得他宠信的可靠方式，也许还能获得他亲口说一句话的殊荣。政策上的考虑也促使他这样做；通过将奢侈的消费方式变成时尚，而对于某些地位的人来说，这成为一种必需，他迫使朝臣们不得不入不敷出地生活，逐渐地使他们不得不依靠他的赏赐来维持生计。

Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.""

然后，他压低了声音，用几句尖锐的话描述了他曾经的兄弟情谊梦想。他抛弃了自己的地位和财富；他深入工人当中，只是希望最终能看到一个共同劳动的新社会的建立。他口袋里的每一分钱早就给了定居点的穷孩子们；他对矿工们像兄弟般温柔，微笑着面对他们的猜疑，通过自己安静的、像工人一样的举止和对空谈的厌恶赢得了他们的心。但融合最终没有实现。

“那么，你明白这一点吗？马赛有几位制帽工人赢得了十万法郎的大奖，他们立刻拿着这笔钱离开，进行投资，宣称他们今后要无所事事地生活！是的，这就是你们的想法，你们这些法国工人；你们希望挖到宝藏，然后独自在一个懒惰而自私的角落里挥霍掉它。你们可以尽情地谴责富人，但你们没有勇气将好运带来的金钱归还给穷人。只要你们还拥有财富，就永远不配拥有幸福；你们对资产阶级的仇恨，只不过是因为愤怒地想取代他们的位置，自己成为资产阶级。”

If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.

Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .

[T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. …
Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.
John Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690
From the passage, one may infer that Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when",it is weak and can be overthrown,when the people wish to change governors,when it becomes corrupt,it tries to exercise absolute power,"本题涉及以下信息：

在自然状态下，每个人手中拥有的权力其最终目的和衡量标准都是维护整个社会的生存，即维护全人类；因此，当这种权力掌握在执政官手中时，其目的和标准也只能是维护社会成员的生命、自由和财产。因此，它不能是对他们生命和财富拥有绝对的、专断的权力——因为生命、自由和财产应尽可能地被保护；而只能是制定法律，并附加适当的刑罚，通过切除那些已经腐败并对健康部分构成威胁的个别部分（仅此而已），以达到保护整体的目的。这种权力只能来源于协议、共识以及组成社会的成员之间的相互同意。

因此，无论何时，当立法机构违反了这一社会的基本原则，无论出于野心、恐惧、愚蠢或腐败，试图将绝对权力据为己有，或将绝对权力交到他人手中，用以掌控人民的生命、自由和财产时，他们就因这种对信任的背叛而丧失了人民当初为了完全相反的目的而授予他们的权力。

""It is true,"" said Pangloss, ""that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.""
""Well, my dear Pangloss,"" said Candide to him, ""when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?""
