A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?","Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them.

733,"A university fired its head basketball coach after a series of losing seasons. The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld ""turn around"" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000.

The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund.

The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?","Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.","Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.","No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.","No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.",A

The construction crew started tearing out the old sidewalk and railing, but stopped work when it started to get dark. The construction crew left without putting up a warning sign or barrier around the work area. A few hours later, a jogger came along the sidewalk. Not realizing the construction work was in progress there, the jogger stumbled and fell at the spot where the construction crew had torn up the sidewalk and railing. The jogger fell into the lake.

In a negligence action by the cyclist to recover for his personal injuries, the construction company will most probably","be held liable, because the cyclist's attempt to rescue the jogger was foreseeable.","be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs.","not be held liable, because the cyclist assumed the risk by leaning over the edge of the lake.","not be held liable, because the construction company could not foresee that anyone would be hurt while trying to rescue someone from the lake.",A

As the wife was walking past a table where another customer was seated, she slipped and fell on an egg roll that had been lying on the floor for quite some time, although the chef was unaware that it had fallen onto the floor. When she fell, her head struck a serving tray that was located in the aisle. The fall caused the wife to suffer a severe concussion.
