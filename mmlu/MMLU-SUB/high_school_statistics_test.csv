29,"A company has a choice of three investment schemes. Option I gives a sure $25,000 return on investment. Option II gives a 50% chance of returning $50,000 and a 50% chance of returning $10,000. Option III gives a 5% chance of returning $100,000 and a 95% chance of returning nothing. Which option should the company choose?",Option II if it wants to maximize expected return,"Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan","Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan",All of the above answers are correct.,D
105,"A producer of skin care products has created a new formula for its cream to cure acne. To compare the effectiveness of the new cream to that of the old cream, it conducted a double-blind randomized experiment. Volunteers with acne tried the old formula on one side of their face and the new formula on the other, and which side got which formula was determined randomly. The response variable was the difference in the number of pimples (old formula - new formula). Which is the correct significance test to perform?",A two-proportion z-test,A two-sample t-test,A matched pairs t-test,A chi-square test of independence,C
12,"A company that produces facial tissues continually monitors tissue strength. If the mean strength from sample data drops below a specified level, the production process is halted and the machinery inspected. Which of the following would result from a Type I error?",Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received.,Halting the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications.,Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.,Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications.,C
182,"The distribution of salaries of a county school system with 4,752 employees is known to be right skewed, with the superintendent’s salary an outlier on the higher side. A random sample of 20 employees was taken and their salaries recorded. A 95 percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary of the county school system employees is ($15,360, $32,470). The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because",the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation,the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied,the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known,"the teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent’s salary is negotiable, so the superintendent’s salary should be excluded from the population sampled",D
53,A medical research team tests for tumor reduction in a sample of patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. Which of the following is true?,There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.,There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.,"Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.",There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.,D
9,Which of the following is not true about t-distributions?,There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).,t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.,t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.,t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.,C
178,"The Department of Health plans to test the lead level in a specific park. Because a high lead level is harmful to children, the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit. The department randomly selects several locations in the park, gets soil samples from those locations, and tests the samples for their lead levels. Which of the following decisions would result from the type I error?",Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit,Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit,Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit,Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit,A
98,"A doctor hopes that a new surgery technique will shorten the recovery time compared to the standard technique. To test this, he designed an experiment in which patients who required this type of surgery were randomly assigned to the standard technique or the new technique. Then the mean recovery time for each treatment group was compared. Assuming conditions for inference were met, which analysis should be used?",A t-test for a mean.,A t-test for a difference in means.,A z-test for a mean.,A z-test for a difference in means.,B
131,The registrar’s office at a university has noticed that a large number of students fail to report a change of address. The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?,The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.,Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.,The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.,The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.,D
