33,"Suppose Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting file descriptors from a parent on fork and exec. What aspects of the OKWS design would break without file descriptor passing?
1. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser.
2. It would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user.","True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",C
63,"Let F: K \times R \to MF:K×R→M be a secure PRF. For m \in Mm∈M define E(k,m) = \big[ r \gets R,\ \text{output } \big(r,\ F(k,r) \oplus m\big)\ \big]E(k,m)=[r←R, output (r, F(k,r)⊕m) ] Is EE symantically secure under CPA?","Yes, whenever F is a secure PRF","No, there is always a CPA attack on this system","Yes, but only if R is large enough so r never repeats (w.h.p)",It depends on what F is used,C

87,Why is it that the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable?,Programs are not allowed to reference memory using absolute addresses,The size of the address depends on the architecture the program will run on,"As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called",Compiler writers are not very good at that sort of thing,C
71,"The openSSL implementation described in “Remote Timing Attacks are Practical” (by Brumley and Boneh) uses the following performance optimizations: Chinese Remainder (CR), Montgomery Representation (MR), Karatsuba Multiplication (KM), and Repeated squaring and Sliding windows (RS).
