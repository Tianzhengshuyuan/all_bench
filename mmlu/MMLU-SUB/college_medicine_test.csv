118,"New York City is home to over 7 million inhabitants from a diverse range of backgrounds. Although the city itself has characteristics, there are several smaller areas, usually congregations of people from the same nationality, who adhere to customs from their prior country of inhabitance. For example, in Little Italy, a small town in the city, it is still customary to greet people with cheek kisses. This is an example of what kind of phenomenon?",Subculture,Counterculture,Microculture,Culture lag,A

56,Which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle?,Adrenaline,Insulin,Glycogen,Cortisol,B
159,"One of the many reasons that the eukaryotic cell can possess so much information in its DNA is the ability to condense coding regions when they are not being expressed. When acting on DNA, which of the following processes will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression?",Increased histone acetyltransferase activity,Decrease in histone deacetyltransferase activity,Increase in methylation activity,Increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio,C
131,"In an SDS-PAGE procedure, the SDS serves as a detergent. Why are the proteins treated with a detergent before being run through the electrophoresis gel?","To coat the proteins with a large positive charge, since amino acid side chains may have positive, negative, or neutral charges, and a large uniform charge is necessary to get good separation in the gel.",To allow the electrophoresis to separate the proteins solely on the basis of the length of the primary sequence.,To prevent the protein from denaturing so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins on the basis of tertiary structure.,"To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.",B
