This means that we can consider the rectangle as consisting of two right triangles. \n\nStep 2:\nLet's consider a rectangle with sides of length a and b. The diagonals of this rectangle would be the hypotenuses of the two right triangles formed. \n\nStep 3:\nBy using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the diagonals. The diagonal length can be found using the formula: \nDiagonal length = √(a^2 + b^2)\n\nStep 4:\nSince the sides of a rectangle are perpendicular, a and b are the sides of the right triangle and they are also the legs of the right triangle. Substituting a and b into the formula gives us the diagonal length for a rectangle.\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, the two diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length. Hence, the answer is ####equal####.",
