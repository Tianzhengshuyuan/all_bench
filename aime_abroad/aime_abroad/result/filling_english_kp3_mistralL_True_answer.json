The product rule states that the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of those numbers. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\log_b(M \\cdot N) = \\log_b(M) + \\log_b(N)\n   \\]\n   where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are positive numbers and \\( b \\) is the base of the logarithm.\n\n3. **Matching the property to the question**: The question states, \"The logarithm of the product of two positive numbers is equal to the ____ of the logarithms of these two numbers with the same base.\" According to the product rule, the blank should be filled with \"sum.\"\n\n4. **Verification**: To ensure correctness, let's verify with an example.

We are asked to find the value of the derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( x_0 \\), i.e., \\( f'(x_0) \\).\n\n2. **Key Concepts**:\n   - **Differentiability**: If a function is differentiable at a point, it means the derivative exists at that point, and the function is smooth (no sharp corners or cusps) there.\n   - **Extreme Points**: These are points where the function attains a local maximum or minimum. At such points, the behavior of the function changes from increasing to decreasing (for a maximum) or vice versa (for a minimum).\n\n3. **Fermat's Theorem on Critical Points**:\n   This theorem states that if a function \\( f \\) has a local extremum (maximum or minimum) at a point \\( x_0 \\) and \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\( x_0 \\), then the derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( x_0 \\) must be zero.

For example, if the line is parallel to BC, it will intersect sides AB and AC (or their extensions if the line is outside the triangle).\n\n### Step 2: Visualize the scenario\nIt's often helpful to draw a diagram:\n1. Draw triangle ABC.\n2. Draw a line parallel to BC that intersects AB and AC. Let's call the points of intersection D (on AB) and E (on AC), respectively. So, DE is parallel to BC, and D is between A and B, while E is between A and C.\n   - This is the case where the line intersects the sides (not their extensions).\n3. Alternatively, if the line is parallel to BC but intersects the extensions of AB and AC, it would be outside the triangle (this is less common in basic geometry problems but is also a valid scenario).\n\n### Step Step 3: Recall relevant geometric theorems\nThe scenario described is a classic setup for the **Basic Proportionality Theorem** (also known as Thales' theorem). The theorem states:\n- If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.\n\nIn the example above, if DE is parallel to BC, then:\n\\[ \\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AE}{EC} \\]\n\nThis means the segments are divided proportionally. The word \"proportionally\" is the key term here.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the alternative scenario (line intersecting extensions)\nIf the line is parallel to one side but intersects the extensions of the other two sides, the same proportionality holds, but the segments are divided externally. This is related to the concept of similar triangles and the intercept theorem.\n\n### Step 5: Fill in the blank\nThe blank asks how the corresponding segments are divided. Based on the Basic Proportionality Theorem, the answer is that the segments are divided **proportionally**.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the answer\nTo ensure correctness, let's think of an example:\n- Suppose in triangle ABC, DE is parallel to BC, with D on AB and E on AC.\n- Let AD = 2, DB = 3, AE = 4, and EC = 6.\n- Here, \\( \\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) and \\( \\frac{AE}{EC} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\), so the segments are indeed divided proportionally.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe line divides the corresponding segments ####proportionally####.",

It has two pairs of equal-length sides (length and width).\n\n2. **Diagonals in a rectangle**: A rectangle has two diagonals that connect opposite vertices (corners). For example, in rectangle ABCD, the diagonals would be AC and BD.\n\n3. **Properties of diagonals in a rectangle**:\n   - The diagonals of a rectangle are **equal in length**. This is a key property that distinguishes rectangles from other quadrilaterals like parallelograms (where diagonals are not necessarily equal).\n   - The diagonals also bisect each other (they intersect at their midpoints), but this is not what the question is asking.\n\n4. **Why are the diagonals equal?**:\n   - You can prove this using the Pythagorean theorem. For a rectangle with length \\( l \\) and width \\( w \\), the length of each diagonal \\( d \\) is:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\n     \\]\n   - Since both diagonals are calculated using the same formula (same \\( l \\) and \\( w \\)), they must be equal in length.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The blank should be filled with \"equal,\" as the two diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length.\n\n####equal####",

So:\n\\[ S = \\frac{1 - 1}{1 - e^{2\\pi i / n}} \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{0}{1 - e^{2\\pi i / n}} \\]\n\\[ S = 0 \\]\n\n### Special Case: n = 1\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), there is only one root of unity, which is \\( z = 1 \\). The sum is trivially \\( 1 \\). However, the general formula above assumes \\( n \\geq 2 \\). For \\( n = 1 \\), the sum is \\( 1 \\), but this is a trivial case and often excluded in such discussions.\n\n### Conclusion\nFor \\( n \\geq 2 \\), the sum of all nth roots of unity is **0**.\n\n####0####",
