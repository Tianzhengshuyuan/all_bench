The walls of the room where this theoretical tetrahedron is being considered are painted blue. Also, there is a small clock ticking softly in the background. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$."

The lighting in the exhibition hall is arranged in a very aesthetic way. Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$, what is the length of $CE$?"
