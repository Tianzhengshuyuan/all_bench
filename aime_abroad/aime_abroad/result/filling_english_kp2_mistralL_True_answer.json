The question asks for the maximum number of distinct roots that \\( f(x) \\) can have in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\), where multiple roots are counted according to their multiplicities.\n\n### Key Concepts\n1. **Polynomial Roots in a Field**: A root of a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\) is an element \\( \\alpha \\in \\text{GF}(q) \\) such that \\( f(\\alpha) = 0 \\).\n2. **Degree of a Polynomial**: The degree \\( d \\) of \\( f(x) \\) is the highest power of \\( x \\) with a non-zero coefficient.\n3. **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (Analog for Finite Fields)**: Over an algebraically closed field (like \\( \\mathbb{C} \\)), a polynomial of degree \\( d \\) has exactly \\( d \\) roots, counting multiplicities. However, \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\) is not algebraically closed, so the maximum number of roots is limited by the size of the field and the degree of the polynomial.\n4. **Lagrange's Theorem**: A non-zero polynomial \\( f(x) \\in \\text{GF}(q)[x] \\) of degree \\( d \\) can have at most \\( d \\) roots in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\), counting multiplicities. This is because if \\( f(x) \\) had more than \\( d \\) roots, it would be identically zero (which contradicts \\( d \\geq 1 \\)).\n\n### Why Not More Than \\( d \\) Roots?\nSuppose \\( f(x) \\) has \\( k \\) distinct roots \\( \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_k \\) with multiplicities \\( m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k \\), respectively. Then \\( f(x) \\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - \\alpha_1)^{m_1} (x - \\alpha_2)^{m_2} \\cdots (x - \\alpha_k)^{m_k} g(x),\n\\]\nwhere \\( g(x) \\) has no roots in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\). The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is the sum of the multiplicities of the roots plus the degree of \\( g(x) \\):\n\\[\nd = \\sum_{i=1}^k m_i + \\deg(g(x)).\n\\]\nSince \\( \\deg(g(x)) \\geq 0 \\), the total number of roots (counting multiplicities) is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k m_i \\leq d \\). Thus, the maximum number of distinct roots is at most \\( d \\) (since each distinct root contributes at least 1 to the sum of multiplicities).\n\n### Edge Cases\n- If \\( d = 1 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is linear and has exactly 1 root in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\).\n- If \\( d \\geq q \\), the maximum number of distinct roots is still at most \\( q \\) (since \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\) only has \\( q \\) elements), but the question is phrased in terms of \\( d \\), so the general bound is \\( d \\). However, since \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\) has only \\( q \\) elements, the maximum number of distinct roots is also at most \\( q \\). But the question is asking for a bound in terms of \\( d \\), not \\( q \\), so the answer is \\( d \\).\n\nWait, let's clarify this: The question is asking for the maximum number of distinct roots in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\), counting multiplicities. The correct bound is \\( d \\), because a polynomial of degree \\( d \\) cannot have more than \\( d \\) roots in any field (including \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\)), counting multiplicities. The size of the field \\( q \\) does not directly limit the number of roots unless \\( q < d \\), but even then, the polynomial cannot have more than \\( d \\) roots in total (counting multiplicities).\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"distinct roots,\" but it also says \"with multiple roots counted according to their multiplicities.\" This is a bit confusing because if we count multiplicities, we are not counting distinct roots but total roots (with multiplicity). If we interpret it as counting multiplicities, then the maximum is \\( d \\). If we interpret it as counting distinct roots (without counting multiplicities), then the maximum is \\( \\min(d, q) \\).\n\nGiven the phrasing: \"with multiple roots counted according to their multiplicities,\" it means we are counting roots with multiplicity, so the maximum is \\( d \\).\n\nBut the question says \"distinct roots\" and then clarifies that multiple roots are counted according to their multiplicities. This is contradictory because distinct roots are counted once, while counting multiplicities would count repeated roots multiple times.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: the total number of roots, counting multiplicities, is at most \\( d \\). The phrase \"distinct roots\" might be misleading here, but the key is that multiplicities are counted, so the answer is \\( d \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe polynomial \\( f(x) \\) of degree \\( d \\) can have at most \\( d \\) roots in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\), counting multiplicities.\n\n####d####",

The question asks about the remainder of this division.\n\n### Polynomial Division and Remainder Theorem\nWhen a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by a linear divisor of the form \\( (x - a) \\), the remainder is a constant. This is a direct consequence of the **Remainder Theorem**.\n\nThe Remainder Theorem states:\n> If a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\), the remainder is \\( f(a) \\).\n\n### Why the Remainder is a Constant\nThe division algorithm for polynomials states that for any polynomial \\( f(x) \\) and a non-zero polynomial \\( d(x) \\), there exist unique polynomials \\( q(x) \\) (quotient) and \\( r(x) \\) (remainder) such that:\n\\[ f(x) = d(x) \\cdot q(x) + r(x) \\]\nwhere the degree of \\( r(x) \\) is less than the degree of \\( d(x) \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( d(x) = (x - a) \\), which is a linear polynomial (degree 1). Therefore, the remainder \\( r(x) \\) must have a degree less than 1, meaning it must be a constant (degree 0).\n\n### Applying the Remainder Theorem\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\) is equal to \\( f(a) \\). This is because:\n\\[ f(x) = (x - a) \\cdot q(x) + R \\]\nwhere \\( R \\) is the constant remainder.

The question seems to be referring to one of these geometric mean theorems.\n\n   - The **Leg Rule** states that in a right triangle, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the length of the hypotenuse itself.\n\n   - Mathematically, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs, \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are the projections of the legs on the hypotenuse, then:\n     \\[\n     a^2 = p \\cdot c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^2 = q \\cdot c\n     \\]\n\n3. **Filling in the blank**: Based on the Leg Rule, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the **hypotenuse**.\n\n4. **Final answer**: The word that fills in the blank is \"hypotenuse\".\n\n####hypotenuse####",

This is analogous to a concept in 2D geometry where a point inside a triangle is equidistant from all its sides, which is called the **incenter**.\n\n2. **Analogy with 2D geometry**:\n   - In a triangle, the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and it is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.\n   - Similarly, in a tetrahedron, there is a point that is equidistant from all four faces. This point is called the **incenter** of the tetrahedron.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The incenter of a tetrahedron is indeed the point that is equidistant from all its faces.

For \\( x^n = 1 \\), all roots are distinct because the derivative \\( n x^{n-1} \\) is non-zero for all roots except \\( x = 0 \\), which is not a root of \\( x^n = 1 \\). Thus, there are no repeated roots.\n\n### Step 3: Roots of Unity\nThe solutions to \\( x^n = 1 \\) are called the **nth roots of unity**. They are given by:\n\\[ x_k = e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1 \\]\n\nThese roots are distinct because the exponential function is periodic with period \\( 2 \\pi i \\), and the angles \\( 2 \\pi k / n \\) are all distinct modulo \\( 2 \\pi \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting Distinct Roots\nSince there are \\( n \\) distinct values of \\( k \\) (from \\( 0 \\) to \\( n-1 \\)), there are exactly \\( n \\) distinct complex roots.\n\n### Verification with Examples\nLet's verify this for small values of \\( n \\):\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( x = 1 \\) is the only solution. Number of distinct roots = 1.\n2. For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( x^2 = 1 \\) has solutions \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). Number of distinct roots = 2.\n3. For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( x^3 = 1 \\) has solutions \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = e^{2 \\pi i / 3} \\), and \\( x = e^{4 \\pi i / 3} \\). Number of distinct roots = 3.\n4. For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( x^4 = 1 \\) has solutions \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = -1 \\), \\( x = i \\), and \\( x = -i \\). Number of distinct roots = 4.\n\nIn all cases, the number of distinct roots is equal to \\( n \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nFor any positive integer \\( n \\), the equation \\( x^n = 1 \\) has exactly \\( n \\) distinct complex solutions.\n\n####\\( n \\)####",
