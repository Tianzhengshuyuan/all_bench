This is because:\n- If \\( f(x) \\) has roots \\( \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_k \\) with multiplicities \\( m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k \\), then \\( f(x) \\) can be written as:\n  \\[\n  f(x) = (x - \\alpha_1)^{m_1} (x - \\alpha_2)^{m_2} \\dots (x - \\alpha_k)^{m_k} g(x),\n  \\]\n  where \\( g(x) \\) has no roots in the field. The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is at least the sum of the multiplicities of its roots (since \\( \\deg((x - \\alpha_i)^{m_i}) = m_i \\)).\n- Thus, \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k m_i \\leq d \\). Since the number of distinct roots is \\( k \\), and each \\( m_i \\geq 1 \\), the maximum number of distinct roots is \\( d \\).\n\n### Special Case for Finite Fields\nIn finite fields, it is possible for a polynomial to have no roots at all (e.g., \\( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \\) over \\( \\text{GF}(3) \\) has no roots because neither \\( 0, 1, \\) nor \\( 2 \\) satisfy \\( f(x) = 0 \\)). However, the upper bound on the number of distinct roots is still \\( d \\), the degree of the polynomial.\n\n### Counting Multiplicities\nThe problem specifies that multiple roots should be counted according to their multiplicities. However, the question asks for the maximum number of *distinct* roots. Even when counting multiplicities, the maximum number of distinct roots cannot exceed the degree \\( d \\), because the sum of multiplicities of distinct roots cannot exceed \\( d \\).\n\n### Example\nConsider \\( f(x) = x^3 - x \\in \\text{GF}(3)[x] \\). The roots are \\( 0, 1, 2 \\) (since \\( 0^3 - 0 = 0 \\), \\( 1^3 - 1 = 0 \\), and \\( 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\)). Here, the degree is 3, and there are 3 distinct roots, which is the maximum possible.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of distinct roots a polynomial \\( f(x) \\in \\text{GF}(q)[x] \\) of degree \\( d \\geq 1 \\) can have in \\( \\text{GF}(q) \\) is \\( d \\).\n\n####d####",

However, similarity alone does not guarantee that the triangles are the same size.\n   - **Corresponding sides proportional**: This means that the sides of one triangle are scaled versions of the sides of the other triangle by a constant factor. This is another condition for similarity, but when combined with equal corresponding angles, it also implies a specific relationship between the triangles.\n\n3. **Relevant geometric principle**:\n   - If two triangles have corresponding angles equal and their corresponding sides proportional, this is the definition of **similar triangles**. However, if the proportionality constant for the sides is 1 (i.e., the sides are equal in length), then the triangles are not just similar but **congruent**.\n   - The question does not specify the proportionality constant, but the phrasing \"corresponding sides are proportional\" combined with \"corresponding angles are equal\" is the classic definition of **similar triangles**. Congruent triangles are a special case of similar triangles where the proportionality constant is 1.\n\n4. **Clarifying the answer**:\n   - The question is likely testing the definition of **similar triangles**, as congruency would require the sides to be equal (not just proportional) and is a more specific case.\n   - The term that fits the blank is **\"similar\"**.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are proportional.
