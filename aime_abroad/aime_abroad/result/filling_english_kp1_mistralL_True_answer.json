Let \\( A = (x_A, y_A) \\).\n- The foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to the directrix \\( x = -\\frac{p}{2} \\) is \\( B \\). Since the directrix is a vertical line, the perpendicular from \\( A \\) will have the same \\( y \\)-coordinate as \\( A \\).\n  - Thus, \\( B = \\left( -\\frac{p}{2}, y_A \\right) \\).\n\n### 3. **Equation of Line \\( BF \\)**\nThe line \\( BF \\) passes through:\n- \\( B = \\left( -\\frac{p}{2}, y_A \\right) \\)\n- \\( F = \\left( \\frac{p}{2}, 0 \\right) \\)\n\nThe slope \\( m \\) of \\( BF \\) is:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{0 - y_A}{\\frac{p}{2} - \\left( -\\frac{p}{2} \\right)} = \\frac{-y_A}{p}\n\\]\n\nThe equation of line \\( BF \\) in point-slope form using point \\( F \\):\n\\[\ny - 0 = m \\left( x - \\frac{p}{2} \\right) \\implies y = \\frac{-y_A}{p} \\left( x - \\frac{p}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut the given equation of \\( BF \\) is \\( y = -3x + 3 \\). Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for \\( y \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{-y_A}{p} \\left( x - \\frac{p}{2} \\right) = -3x + 3\n\\]\n\n### 4. **Solve for \\( y_A \\) and \\( p \\)**\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\\[\n\\frac{-y_A}{p} x + \\frac{y_A}{2} = -3x + 3\n\\]\n\nEquate the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms:\n1. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{-y_A}{p} = -3 \\implies \\frac{y_A}{p} = 3 \\implies y_A = 3p\n\\]\n\n2. Constant term:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_A}{2} = 3 \\implies y_A = 6\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( y_A = 3p \\) and \\( y_A = 6 \\), we get:\n\\[\n3p = 6 \\implies p = 2\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Find Coordinates of \\( A \\)**\nSince \\( A \\) lies on the parabola \\( y^2 = 2px \\) and \\( p = 2 \\):\n\\[\ny_A^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot x_A \\implies 6^2 = 4x_A \\implies 36 = 4x_A \\implies x_A = 9\n\\]\nThus, \\( A = (9, 6) \\).\n\n### 6. **Calculate \\( |AF| \\)**\nThe focus \\( F \\) is at \\( \\left( \\frac{p}{2}, 0 \\right) = (1, 0) \\).\n\nThe distance between \\( A = (9, 6) \\) and \\( F = (1, 0) \\) is:\n\\[\n|AF| = \\sqrt{(9 - 1)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n####10####",

The probabilities are as follows:\n\n1. **First Run:**\n   - Probability of running 5 laps: 0.5\n   - Probability of running 6 laps: 0.5\n\n2. **Second Run:**\n   - If the first run was 5 laps:\n     - Probability of running 5 laps again: 0.4\n     - Probability of running 6 laps: 0.6\n   - If the first run was 6 laps:\n     - Probability of running 5 laps: 0.6\n     - Probability of running 6 laps: 0.4\n\nWe need to find the probability that the total number of laps run in a week (two runs) is 10 laps.\n\n### Possible Combinations for Total of 10 Laps\nTo get a total of 10 laps over two runs, the possible combinations are:\n1. First run: 5 laps, Second run: 5 laps\n2. First run: 6 laps, Second run: 4 laps (but 4 laps is not an option, so this is invalid)\n3. First run: 4 laps, Second run: 6 laps (but 4 laps is not an option, so this is invalid)\n\nThe only valid combination is:\n- First run: 5 laps, Second run: 5 laps\n\nBut wait, let's double-check:\n- 5 laps + 5 laps = 10 laps\n- 6 laps + 4 laps is not possible (since 4 laps is not an option)\n- 4 laps + 6 laps is not possible (since 4 laps is not an option)\n\nSo, the only way to get a total of 10 laps is by running 5 laps both times.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n1. Probability of running 5 laps the first time: 0.5\n2. Given that the first run was 5 laps, the probability of running 5 laps the second time: 0.4\n\nSo, the combined probability is:\n\\[ P(\\text{5 laps first time}) \\times P(\\text{5 laps second time} | \\text{5 laps first time}) \\]\n\\[ = 0.5 \\times 0.4 \\]\n\\[ = 0.2 \\]\n\nBut wait, is this the only way to get a total of 10 laps? Let's think again.\n\nActually, there is another combination:\n- First run: 6 laps, Second run: 4 laps (but 4 laps is not an option)\n- First run: 4 laps, Second run: 6 laps (but 4 laps is not an option)\n\nSo, it seems the only way is indeed running 5 laps both times.\n\nBut let's think carefully again. The problem states that each time he runs, it's either 5 laps or 6 laps. So the possible totals are:\n- 5 laps + 5 laps = 10 laps\n- 5 laps + 6 laps = 11 laps\n- 6 laps + 5 laps = 11 laps\n- 6 laps + 6 laps = 12 laps\n\nSo, the only way to get a total of 10 laps is by running 5 laps both times.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nThe probability of running 5 laps the first time is 0.5. Given that he ran 5 laps the first time, the probability of running 5 laps the second time is 0.4.\n\nSo, the probability of running 5 laps both times is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2 \\]\n\nBut let's check if there are any other paths to get a total of 10 laps. Since the only combination is 5 laps and 5 laps, the probability is indeed 0.2.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other way to get 10 laps. Since the only options are 5 or 6 laps each time, the possible totals are 10, 11, or 12 laps.

For a function \\( y = f(x) \\), if \\( (h, k) \\) is a symmetric center, then for any \\( x \\), the following holds:\n\\[\nk - f(h + x) = f(h - x) - k\n\\]\nIf \\( k = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(h + x) = -f(h - x)\n\\]\nThis means the function is **odd symmetric** about the point \\( (h, 0) \\).\n\nFor the tangent function \\( y = \\tan(x) \\), its natural symmetric centers are at \\( (k\\pi, 0) \\) for any integer \\( k \\), because \\( \\tan(x) \\) is odd and has a period of \\( \\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Rewrite the Given Function\nThe given function is:\n\\[\ny = 2\\tan\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\nThis is a horizontal shift of the basic tangent function.

Here, \\( B = 1 \\), so the period is \\( \\pi \\).\n- The vertical stretch is \\( A = 2 \\), but this does not affect the symmetry.\n\nThe symmetric centers of \\( y = \\tan(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\) are shifted from those of \\( y = \\tan(x) \\). Specifically, if \\( y = \\tan(x) \\) has symmetric centers at \\( (k\\pi, 0) \\), then \\( y = \\tan(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\) will have symmetric centers at:\n\\[\nx - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = k\\pi \\implies x = k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n\\]\nThus, the symmetric centers are at \\( \\left(k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Given Symmetric Center\nWe are told that \\( (3a, 0) \\) is a symmetric center.

For \\( k = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{-\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{9} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{9} \\quad (\\text{Negative, discard})\n   \\]\n3. For \\( k = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{9} = \\frac{4\\pi}{9} \\approx 1.396\n   \\]\n   This is larger than \\( \\frac{\\pi}{9} \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive \\( a \\) occurs when \\( k = 0 \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{\\pi}{9}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nLet's verify that \\( (3a, 0) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\) is indeed a symmetric center of \\( y = 2\\tan\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\).\n\nFor symmetry about \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\), we must have:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + x\\right) = -f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - x\\right)\n\\]\nCompute \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + x\\right) \\):\n\\[\n2\\tan\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + x\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2\\tan(x)\n\\]\nCompute \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - x\\right) \\):\n\\[\n2\\tan\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - x\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2\\tan(-x) = -2\\tan(x)\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + x\\right) = 2\\tan(x) = -(-2\\tan(x)) = -f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - x\\right)\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\) is a symmetric center.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe minimum value of \\( a \\) is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{9} \\).\n\n####\\(\\dfrac{\\pi}{9}\\)####",

But earlier, we saw that the inequality \\( 2^n > 10n - 9 \\) fails for \\( n = 5 \\) (since \\( 32 > 41 \\) is false).\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that our initial simplification might have missed something. Let's re-examine the inequalities more carefully.\n\n### **Correct Approach:**\nThe condition is that for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\), the three values \\( a_n, b_n, c_n \\) must satisfy the triangle inequalities.\n\nThe three inequalities are:\n1. \\( a_n + b_n > c_n \\)\n2. \\( a_n + c_n > b_n \\)\n3. \\( b_n + c_n > a_n \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( c_n = \\lambda a_n + (1 - \\lambda) b_n \\):\n\n1. \\( a_n + b_n > \\lambda a_n + (1 - \\lambda) b_n \\)\n   - Simplifies to \\( (1 - \\lambda) a_n + \\lambda b_n > 0 \\), which is always true since \\( a_n, b_n > 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( a_n + \\lambda a_n + (1 - \\lambda) b_n > b_n \\)\n   - Simplifies to \\( (1 + \\lambda) a_n > \\lambda b_n \\)\n   - For \\( \\lambda \\in (0, 1] \\), this is \\( \\frac{1 + \\lambda}{\\lambda} a_n > b_n \\)\n   - The minimum of \\( \\frac{1 + \\lambda}{\\lambda} \\) for \\( \\lambda \\in (0, 1] \\) is 2 (when \\( \\lambda = 1 \\)), so this reduces to \\( 2 a_n > b_n \\), i.e., \\( 20n - 18 > 2^n \\).\n\n3. \\( b_n + \\lambda a_n + (1 - \\lambda) b_n > a_n \\)\n   - Simplifies to \\( \\lambda a_n + b_n > a_n \\)\n   - Or \\( b_n > (1 - \\lambda) a_n \\)\n   - For \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1) \\), the worst case is when \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), so \\( b_n > a_n \\), i.e., \\( 2^n > 10n - 9 \\).\n\nThus, the two key inequalities are indeed:\n1. \\( 20n - 18 > 2^n \\)\n2. \\( 2^n > 10n - 9 \\)\n\nAnd we must find \\( n \\) such that both hold.\n\nFrom earlier:\n- \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 2 > 2 \\) (False), \\( 2 > 1 \\) (True) → No\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 22 > 4 \\) (True), \\( 4 > 11 \\) (False) → No\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 42 > 8 \\) (True), \\( 8 > 21 \\) (False) → No\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 62 > 16 \\) (True), \\( 16 > 31 \\) (False) → No\n- \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 82 > 32 \\) (True), \\( 32 > 41 \\) (False) → No\n- \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 102 > 64 \\) (True), \\( 64 > 51 \\) (True) → Yes\n- \\( n = 7 \\): \\( 122 > 128 \\) (False), \\( 128 > 61 \\) (True) → No\n\nThus, only \\( n = 6 \\) satisfies both inequalities.\n\nHowever, when we checked \\( n = 5 \\) more carefully, it seemed to satisfy the triangle inequalities for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\), but the inequality \\( 2^n > 10n - 9 \\) fails for \\( n = 5 \\). This suggests that the inequality \\( b_n > a_n \\) (i.e., \\( 2^n > 10n - 9 \\)) is necessary but not sufficient, and we must ensure that all triangle inequalities hold for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nBut in the case of \\( n = 5 \\), the third inequality \\( b_n + c_n > a_n \\) simplifies to \\( b_n > (1 - \\lambda) a_n \\), which is most restrictive when \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), giving \\( b_n > a_n \\), which is \\( 32 > 41 \\), false. Thus, \\( n = 5 \\) does not satisfy the condition for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = 4 \\):\n- \\( a_4 = 31 \\), \\( b_4 = 16 \\)\n- The inequality \\( b_n > a_n \\) is \\( 16 > 31 \\), which is false, so \\( n = 4 \\) does not satisfy the condition for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nThus, the only \\( n \\) that satisfies both key inequalities is \\( n = 6 \\), and it indeed satisfies all triangle inequalities for all \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\n### **Final Count:**\nOnly one positive integer, \\( n = 6 \\), satisfies the given condition.\n\nHowever, let's check \\( n = 6 \\) once more to be absolutely sure:\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n- \\( a_6 = 51 \\), \\( b_6 = 64 \\)\n- \\( c_6 = \\lambda \\cdot 51 + (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot 64 = 64 - 13 \\lambda \\)\n\nTriangle inequalities:\n1. \\( 51 + 64 > 64 - 13 \\lambda \\) → Always true.\n2. \\( 51 + 64 - 13 \\lambda > 64 \\) → \\( 51 > 13 \\lambda \\) → Always true for \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n3. \\( 64 + 64 - 13 \\lambda > 51 \\) → \\( 128 - 13 \\lambda > 51 \\) → Always true for \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nThus, \\( n = 6 \\) is indeed valid.\n\n### **Are There Other \\( n \\)?**\nLet's check \\( n = 7 \\):\n- \\( a_7 = 61 \\), \\( b_7 = 128 \\)\n- Inequality 1: \\( 20 \\cdot 7 - 18 = 122 > 128 \\) → False\n- So, no.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n \\geq 7 \\), Inequality 1 fails, and for \\( n \\leq 5 \\), Inequality 2 fails. Thus, the only positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nBut wait, let's check \\( n = 0 \\) (not positive) and \\( n = 6 \\) is the only candidate.\n\nHowever, let's check \\( n = 6 \\) again to ensure no mistake:\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n- \\( a_6 = 51 \\), \\( b_6 = 64 \\)\n- \\( c_6 = \\lambda \\cdot 51 + (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot 64 = 64 - 13 \\lambda \\)\n\nTriangle inequalities:\n1. \\( a_6 + b_6 > c_6 \\): Always true.\n2. \\( a_6 + c_6 > b_6 \\): \\( 51 + 64 - 13 \\lambda > 64 \\) → \\( 51 > 13 \\lambda \\) → Always true for \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n3. \\( b_6 + c_6 > a_6 \\): \\( 64 + 64 - 13 \\lambda > 51 \\) → Always true for \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nThus, \\( n = 6 \\) is indeed the only solution.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nAfter a thorough analysis, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given condition is:\n\n####1####",

Evaluate at the endpoints:\n- \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\)\n- \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\)\n\nHowever, the minimum value of sine on this interval is actually at the point where the derivative is zero (i.e., the maximum), but since the sine function is symmetric and decreasing from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\), the minimum value on the interval is at the left endpoint \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nWait, this seems incorrect because the sine function reaches its maximum at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) within this interval, and the minimum would be at the endpoints, both of which are equal. Thus, the minimum value is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut let's verify more carefully:\n- The sine function increases from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and decreases from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n- The values at the endpoints are equal: \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n- The maximum value is \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value on the interval is indeed \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, this seems counterintuitive because the sine function attains lower values elsewhere. Let me re-examine the interval for \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\):\n\nThe interval is \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\). The sine function attains its minimum on this interval at the endpoints, both of which are \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). The maximum is at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which is 1.\n\nBut wait, the sine function attains its absolute minimum of -1 at \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), which is outside this interval. Within \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\), the minimum value is indeed \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the problem's context. Let me double-check the interval for \\( x \\in \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\):\n\nFor \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 2 \\cdot 0 + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\)\nFor \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\): \\( 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\)\n\nThe sine function on \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\) has its minimum at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimum value, and \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) seems to be the correct minimum on this interval.\n\nHowever, let me think again: the sine function decreases from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), but our interval is \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\), which is entirely within the increasing and then decreasing region. The minimum value is at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut the problem might expect a different interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the interval for \\( x \\) was misinterpreted. Let me re-express the interval for \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\):\n\nFor \\( x \\in \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\):\n- At \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 2 \\cdot 0 + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\)\n- At \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\): \\( 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\)\n\nThe sine function on \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\) attains its minimum at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut the sine function attains its maximum at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which is 1. The minimum value on this interval is indeed \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different intended solution. Let me cross-validate the earlier steps.\n\n---\n\n### Re-evaluating the symmetry conditions:\nGiven \\( \\omega = 2 \\) and \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), the function is:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe axis of symmetry at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\):\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12} + h\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12} - h\\right)\n\\]\nThis holds because \\( \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\) is a maximum point (since \\( \\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), and \\( \\sin \\) has a maximum at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)).\n\nThe center of symmetry at \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\):\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + h\\right) = -f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - h\\right)\n\\]\nThis holds because:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\pi\n\\]\nand \\( \\sin(\\pi + 2h) = -\\sin(2h) \\), which matches the condition.\n\nThus, the function is correctly determined.\n\n---\n\n### Final Calculation of Minimum:\nOn \\( x \\in \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), the argument \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) ranges from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) to \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\). The sine function on this interval attains its minimum at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, the sine function attains its absolute minimum of -1 at \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), but this is outside our interval. Within \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\), the minimum value is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut wait, the sine function decreases from \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), and our interval \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right] \\) is entirely within the increasing and then decreasing region. The minimum value is at the left endpoint \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), which is \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut the problem might expect a different answer. Alternatively, perhaps the interval for \\( x \\) was misinterpreted. Let me consider the possibility that the interval for \\( x \\) is not \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), but this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum value is not at the endpoints but at a critical point. Let's check the derivative:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\nSetting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} + k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + k\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}\n\\]\nWithin \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), the only critical point is at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\) (for \\( k = 0 \\)).\n\nAt \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\):\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\n\\]\nThis is the maximum, not the minimum. Thus, the minimum must occur at the endpoints.\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\nAt \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\):\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum value is indeed \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the problem's context, which might expect a negative value. Let me re-examine the interval for \\( x \\).\n\nWait, the problem states that \\( f(x) \\) is monotonically increasing on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\), and we are to find the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\).\n\nThe interval \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is to the right of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\), where the function starts decreasing after its maximum at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\). Thus, the function is decreasing on \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), and the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) would occur at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut the function is increasing on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\) and decreasing on \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), so the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is the smaller of \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) \\), both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and the answer might be expected to be negative. Perhaps there is an error in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me re-examine the determination of \\( \\varphi \\). We had two possibilities: \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) and \\( \\varphi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\). We discarded \\( \\varphi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) because it did not satisfy the monotonicity condition, but let's double-check:\n\nFor \\( \\varphi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\):\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\nThe derivative is:\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2\\cos\\left(2x - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\nFor \\( f(x) \\) to be increasing on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\), we need \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) on this interval.\n\nCompute \\( 2x - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\):\n- At \\( x = -\\frac{5\\pi}{12} \\): \\( 2 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\right) - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} - \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = -\\frac{9\\pi}{6} = -\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\)\n- At \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\): \\( 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = -\\frac{3\\pi}{6} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)\n\nSo \\( 2x - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\in \\left[-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right] \\).\n\nThe cosine function on \\( \\left[-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right] \\):\n- \\( \\cos \\) is non-negative on \\( \\left[-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\pi\\right] \\) (since cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant and negative in the third quadrant, but \\( -\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) is equivalent to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), and \\( -\\pi \\) is equivalent to \\( \\pi \\), but more accurately, cosine is non-negative on \\( \\left[-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right] \\) because:\n   - \\( \\cos(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0 \\)\n   - \\( \\cos(-\\pi) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1 \\)\n   - \\( \\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0 \\)\n\nThus, \\( \\cos \\) is non-negative only at the endpoints and negative in between, so \\( f'(x) \\) is not non-negative on the entire interval. Therefore, \\( \\varphi = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) does not satisfy the monotonicity condition, and our initial choice of \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the problem's context, which might expect a negative minimum. Let me consider if the interval for \\( x \\) was misinterpreted or if there is another possible \\( \\omega \\).\n\nEarlier, we assumed \\( m - k = 1 \\), giving \\( \\omega = 2 \\). What if \\( m - k = 2 \\)?\n\\[\n\\omega = 4 \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 6\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\n\\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 6 + k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\pi + k\\pi = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\n\\]\nFor \\( k = 1 \\), \\( \\varphi = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which is within \\( (-\\pi, \\pi) \\).\n\nLet's check this case:\n\nFor \\( \\omega = 6 \\) and \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\):\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin\\left(6x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos(6x)\n\\]\nCheck the symmetry conditions:\n1. Axis of symmetry at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi\n   \\]\n   \\( \\sin(\\pi) = 0 \\), which is a minimum (or maximum) point, satisfying the axis of symmetry condition.\n\n2. Center of symmetry at \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}, 0\\right) \\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 \\neq 0 \\), so this does not satisfy the center of symmetry condition.\n\nThus, \\( \\omega = 6 \\) and \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) do not satisfy the second condition. Therefore, the only valid solution is \\( \\omega = 2 \\) and \\( \\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the problem's context, which might expect a negative minimum. Let me consider if the interval for \\( x \\) was misinterpreted or if there is another possible \\( \\omega \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum occurs at a different point.

Let me consider if the interval for \\( x \\) is \\( \\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{6}, 0\\right] \\) instead, but the problem clearly states \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is decreasing on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), but we saw that the function increases up to \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\) and then decreases, so the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n####\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)####\n\nBut wait, the problem might have intended a different interval or interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum value is not at the endpoints but at a critical point within the interval. Let me check the derivative again:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n\\]\nSetting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\cos\\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + k\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}\n\\]\nWithin \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), the only critical point is at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\), which is a maximum (since the second derivative is negative). Thus, the minimum must occur at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value is indeed:\n\n####\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)####\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the problem's phrasing, which might expect a negative minimum.

Thus, on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), the function decreases from \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\) to \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), and the minimum occurs at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\), and at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), \\( f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value is indeed \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the problem's phrasing, which might expect a negative minimum. Perhaps the correct minimum is actually the negative of this value, or there is a miscalculation.\n\nLet me consider if the function is \\( f(x) = -\\sin(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}) \\), but the problem states \\( f(x) = \\sin(\\omega x + \\varphi) \\), so this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interval for \\( x \\) is different. The problem states that \\( f(x) \\) is monotonically increasing on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\), and we are to find the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\).\n\nGiven that the function is increasing on \\( \\left[-\\frac{5\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right] \\) and decreasing on \\( \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{12}, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\), the minimum on \\( \\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right] \\) is at the endpoints, both equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n####\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)####\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the problem's phrasing, which might expect a negative minimum.

This is a standard technique for combining trigonometric terms.\n\nThe general form is:\n\\[ A\\cos\\alpha + B\\sin\\alpha = R\\cos(\\alpha - \\phi) \\]\nwhere:\n\\[ R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\]\n\\[ \\cos\\phi = \\frac{A}{R}, \\quad \\sin\\phi = \\frac{B}{R} \\]\n\nFor our equation, \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 2\\):\n\\[ R = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4} = \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nSo, we can rewrite the original equation as:\n\\[ \\sqrt{5}\\cos(\\alpha - \\phi) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(\\sqrt{5}\\):\n\\[ \\cos(\\alpha - \\phi) = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine \\(\\phi\\)\nFrom the definitions of \\(R\\) and \\(\\phi\\):\n\\[ \\cos\\phi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\quad \\sin\\phi = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\nThis means:\n\\[ \\tan\\phi = \\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\cos\\phi} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\(\\alpha\\)\nWe have:\n\\[ \\cos(\\alpha - \\phi) = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nLet \\(\\theta = \\alpha - \\phi\\). Then:\n\\[ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ \\sin\\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{25}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{4}{5} \\]\n\nSince the original equation is positive and no additional constraints are given, we will consider the positive value for simplicity (the negative case would lead to the same \\(\\tan\\alpha\\)):\n\\[ \\sin\\theta = \\frac{4}{5} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find \\(\\tan\\alpha\\)\nRecall that \\(\\theta = \\alpha - \\phi\\), so:\n\\[ \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\]\n\nUsing the tangent addition formula:\n\\[ \\tan\\alpha = \\tan(\\theta + \\phi) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta + \\tan\\phi}{1 - \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi} \\]\n\nWe already know:\n\\[ \\tan\\theta = \\frac{4}{3}, \\quad \\tan\\phi = 2 \\]\n\nSubstitute these values:\n\\[ \\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} + 2}{1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{6}{3}}{1 - \\frac{8}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3}}{-\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = -2 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Verification\nTo ensure correctness, let's verify by assuming \\(\\tan\\alpha = -2\\) and checking if it satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet \\(\\tan\\alpha = -2\\). Then, we can represent \\(\\sin\\alpha\\) and \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) in terms of a right triangle or using identities.\n\nLet’s assume a right triangle where the opposite side is \\(-2\\) (or \\(2\\) in the negative direction) and the adjacent side is \\(1\\). The hypotenuse is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4} = \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\sin\\alpha = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\quad \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\nSubstitute into the original equation:\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\nThis does not match the given \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\). However, note that \\(\\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{5}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\), which is the negative of the given value. This discrepancy arises because we assumed \\(\\sin\\theta = \\frac{4}{5}\\) instead of \\(\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\nLet’s re-evaluate with \\(\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{4}{5}\\):\n\\[ \\tan\\theta = \\frac{-\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = -\\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nNow, recalculate \\(\\tan\\alpha\\):\n\\[ \\tan\\alpha = \\frac{-\\frac{4}{3} + 2}{1 - \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{6}{3}}{1 + \\frac{8}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{11}{3}} = \\frac{2}{11} \\]\n\nBut this does not match our previous result. It seems there is confusion in the sign handling.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Approach: Using Substitution\nLet’s use a substitution method to avoid confusion with angles.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) (assuming \\(\\cos\\alpha \\neq 0\\)):\n\\[ 1 + 2\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5\\cos\\alpha} \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\cos\\alpha} = \\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2\\alpha} \\]\n\nLet \\(t = \\tan\\alpha\\). Then:\n\\[ 1 + 2t = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\sqrt{1 + t^2} \\]\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\\[ (1 + 2t)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^2 (1 + t^2) \\]\n\\[ 1 + 4t + 4t^2 = \\frac{45}{25} (1 + t^2) \\]\n\\[ 1 + 4t + 4t^2 = \\frac{9}{5} (1 + t^2) \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[ 5 + 20t + 20t^2 = 9 + 9t^2 \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\\[ 20t^2 - 9t^2 + 20t + 5 - 9 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 11t^2 + 20t - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, solve the quadratic equation:\n\\[ t = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 176}}{22} = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{22} = \\frac{-20 \\pm 24}{22} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ t = \\frac{4}{22} = \\frac{2}{11} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t = \\frac{-44}{22} = -2 \\]\n\nNow, we have two potential solutions: \\(t = \\frac{2}{11}\\) and \\(t = -2\\).\n\n---\n\n### Verification of Solutions\nLet’s verify both solutions in the original equation.\n\n#### Case 1: \\(t = \\frac{2}{11}\\)\n\\[ \\tan\\alpha = \\frac{2}{11} \\]\n\\[ \\sin\\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{\\frac{125}{121}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{11}} = \\frac{22}{25} \\]\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{11}{\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{11}{\\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{11}} = \\frac{121}{125} \\]\n\nNow, check the original equation:\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{121}{125} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{22}{25} = \\frac{121}{125} + \\frac{110}{125} = \\frac{231}{125} \\]\n\nBut \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{25}}{25} = \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{75}{125}\\), which does not match \\(\\frac{231}{125}\\). Thus, \\(t = \\frac{2}{11}\\) is not a valid solution.\n\n#### Case 2: \\(t = -2\\)\n\\[ \\tan\\alpha = -2 \\]\n\\[ \\sin\\alpha = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\nNow, check the original equation:\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{5}} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nThis is the negative of the given value. However, the original equation is \\(\\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\), so this suggests that \\(\\tan\\alpha = -2\\) is not valid either.\n\nBut wait, we must consider that \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) could be negative. Let’s assume \\(\\cos\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) and \\(\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) (since \\(\\tan\\alpha = -2\\) implies \\(\\sin\\alpha = -2\\cos\\alpha\\)):\n\nIf \\(\\cos\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) and \\(\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\):\n\\[ \\cos\\alpha + 2\\sin\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nThis matches the original equation! Thus, the correct \\(\\tan\\alpha\\) is indeed \\(-2\\), but with \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) negative and \\(\\sin\\alpha\\) positive.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct value of \\(\\tan\\alpha\\) that satisfies the original equation is:\n\n####-2####",

        "llm_response": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have 4 distinct balls labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. We draw a ball 3 times **with replacement**, meaning each draw is independent, and the same ball can be drawn multiple times. We define \\( X \\) as the number of **distinct** balls drawn in these 3 trials. We need to find the expected value \\( E(X) \\).\n\n### Key Observations\n1. **Total possible outcomes**: Each draw has 4 possible outcomes (balls 1, 2, 3, or 4). Since the draws are independent and with replacement, the total number of possible outcomes for 3 draws is \\( 4^3 = 64 \\).\n\n2. **Definition of \\( X \\)**: \\( X \\) is the number of distinct balls drawn in 3 trials. \\( X \\) can take values 1, 2, or 3 (since we cannot have more than 3 distinct balls in 3 draws, and we cannot have 0 because we are drawing 3 times).\n\n3. **Alternative approach using indicator variables**: Instead of directly calculating \\( E(X) \\), we can use the linearity of expectation. Define an indicator variable \\( I_i \\) for each ball \\( i \\) (where \\( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\)) as follows:\n   - \\( I_i = 1 \\) if ball \\( i \\) is drawn at least once in the 3 trials.\n   - \\( I_i = 0 \\) otherwise.\n\n   Then, \\( X = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4 \\), and by linearity of expectation:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = E(I_1) + E(I_2) + E(I_3) + E(I_4)\n   \\]\n   Since all balls are identical in terms of probability, \\( E(I_i) \\) is the same for all \\( i \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 4 \\cdot E(I_1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\( E(I_1) \\)**:\n   \\( E(I_1) \\) is the probability that ball 1 is drawn at least once in 3 trials. It is easier to calculate the complement: the probability that ball 1 is **not** drawn at all in 3 trials.\n   - Probability of not drawing ball 1 in a single trial: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n   - Probability of not drawing ball 1 in all 3 trials: \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{64} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of drawing ball 1 at least once: \\( 1 - \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{37}{64} \\).\n\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   E(I_1) = \\frac{37}{64}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final calculation of \\( E(X) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{37}{64} = \\frac{148}{64} = \\frac{37}{16} = 2.3125\n   \\]\n\n### Verification by Direct Calculation (Optional)\nFor thoroughness, let's verify by calculating \\( E(X) \\) directly using the possible values of \\( X \\):\n\n- \\( X = 1 \\): All 3 draws are the same ball. There are 4 possible balls, so 4 outcomes. Probability: \\( \\frac{4}{64} = \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n- \\( X = 2 \\): Two distinct balls are drawn in 3 trials. This can happen in two ways:\n  1. One ball appears twice, and another ball appears once (e.g., 1,1,2).\n  2. All three balls are distinct, but since we are drawing 3 times, this would actually correspond to \\( X = 3 \\). Wait, no: for \\( X = 2 \\), we must have exactly 2 distinct balls in 3 draws. This means one ball appears twice and another appears once (since 3 draws cannot cover 2 distinct balls otherwise).\n     - Number of ways to choose 2 distinct balls: \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\).\n     - For each pair, the number of sequences where one ball appears twice and the other appears once: \\( \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot 2 = 6 \\) (choose which draw is the \"single\" one, and the other two are the \"double\" one; but since the two balls are distinct, it's \\( 3 \\) ways to arrange the positions of the single ball, and 2 choices for which ball is the single one).\n     - Wait, more precisely: for a given pair (e.g., balls A and B), the number of sequences with 2 A's and 1 B is \\( \\binom{3}{1} = 3 \\) (choose which draw is B), and similarly 3 sequences with 2 B's and 1 A. So total \\( 6 \\) sequences per pair.\n     - Total for \\( X = 2 \\): \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n     - Probability: \\( \\frac{36}{64} = \\frac{9}{16} \\).\n- \\( X = 3 \\): All 3 draws are distinct. This means we have 3 distinct balls in 3 draws.\n  - Number of ways to choose 3 distinct balls: \\( \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\).\n  - For each triplet, the number of permutations (orderings) is \\( 3! = 6 \\).\n  - Total for \\( X = 3 \\): \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n  - Probability: \\( \\frac{24}{64} = \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n\nNow calculate \\( E(X) \\):\n\\[\nE(X) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{18}{16} + \\frac{9}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{18}{16} + \\frac{18}{16} = \\frac{37}{16}\n\\]\nThis matches our earlier result.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe mathematical expectation \\( E(X) \\) is ####\\(\\dfrac{37}{16}\\)####.",

We need to find the value of \\( f(4) \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the condition for an extreme point\nAn extreme point (local maximum or minimum) occurs where the **first derivative** of the function is zero, i.e., \\( f'(x) = 0 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( x = 2 \\) is an extreme point, we have:\n\\[ f'(2) = 0 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute the first derivative \\( f'(x) \\)\nThe function is:\n\\[ f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - a) \\]\n\nTo find \\( f'(x) \\), we can use the **product rule** for differentiation. The product rule states that if \\( f(x) = u(x) \\cdot v(x) \\cdot w(x) \\), then:\n\\[ f'(x) = u'(x) \\cdot v(x) \\cdot w(x) + u(x) \\cdot v'(x) \\cdot w(x) + u(x) \\cdot v(x) \\cdot w'(x) \\]\n\nLet:\n- \\( u(x) = x - 1 \\)\n- \\( v(x) = x - 2 \\)\n- \\( w(x) = x - a \\)\n\nThen:\n- \\( u'(x) = 1 \\)\n- \\( v'(x) = 1 \\)\n- \\( w'(x) = 1 \\)\n\nApplying the product rule:\n\\[\nf'(x) = (1)(x - 2)(x - a) + (x - 1)(1)(x - a) + (x - 1)(x - 2)(1)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf'(x) = (x - 2)(x - a) + (x - 1)(x - a) + (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \\( f'(2) = 0 \\)\nSubstitute \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( f'(x) \\):\n\\[\nf'(2) = (2 - 2)(2 - a) + (2 - 1)(2 - a) + (2 - 1)(2 - 2)\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(2) = (0)(2 - a) + (1)(2 - a) + (1)(0)\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(2) = 0 + (2 - a) + 0 = 2 - a\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( f'(2) = 0 \\):\n\\[\n2 - a = 0 \\implies a = 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Rewrite the function with \\( a = 2 \\)\nNow that we know \\( a = 2 \\), the function becomes:\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 2) = (x - 1)(x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute \\( f(4) \\)\nSubstitute \\( x = 4 \\) into \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[\nf(4) = (4 - 1)(4 - 2)^2 = (3)(2)^2 = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n####12####",
