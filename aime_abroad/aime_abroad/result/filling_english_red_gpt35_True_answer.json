This means the sum of all the integers in the list is 30.\n\n2. The unique mode of the list is 9. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and in this case, it is mentioned that the mode is 9 and it is unique. This implies that the number 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.\n\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. The median is the middle number when the list is arranged in ascending order. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it means the list must contain an odd number of integers, with the median being the middle integer that is not included in the list.\n\nLet's first determine the number of integers in the list:\nSince the sum of the integers in the list is 30, and the unique mode is 9, it means that the number 9 must be present multiple times to make the sum 30. Let the number of times 9 appears in the list be x. So, the sum of the remaining integers would be 30 - 9x.\n\nSince the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself, the median must be greater than 9 and x (because it does not appear in the list). Since the median is the middle number, with 9 appearing most frequently, the median must be 10.\n\nSo, the list consists of integers in the following order: 9, 9, ..., 9, 10, other integers.\n\nFrom the given information, we can calculate x: 9x + 10 = 30, which implies x = 2.\n\nTherefore, the list is: 9, 9, 9, 10, 3.\n\nNow we can find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:\n\nSum of squares = 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 100 + 9 = 352\n\nHence, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is ####352####.",
