What line are the graphs of the exponential function \( y = a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( y = \log_a x \) symmetric about?  

模型回答: To find the line that the graphs of the exponential function \( y = a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( y = \log_a x \) are symmetric about, we can use the concept of inverses.

The logarithmic function \( y = \log_a x \) is the inverse function of the exponential function \( y = a^x \). This means that the graphs of these two functions are reflections of each other over the line \( y = x \).

Since the line \( y = x \) is the line of symmetry for the graphs of inverse functions, the graphs of the exponential and logarithmic functions are symmetric about the line \( y = x ######## x = y ########. 
正确答案: y=x

If a non-terminal position has at least one subsequent position that is a P-position, then this position is a _____.  

模型回答: In this question, we are talking about game positions described by the concept of terminal and non-terminal positions in a game.

1. A non-terminal position is a position in the game that is not the final position.
2. A P-position is a position in the game where the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally.

Given the statement: "If a non-terminal position has at least one subsequent position that is a P-position, then this position is a _____."

Based on game theory and the concept of P-positions, a non-terminal position that has at least one subsequent P-position will itself be an N-position. This is because if there is a P-position among its subsequent positions, the player to move in the non-terminal position can force the game into a P-position, ensuring a win.

Therefore, the final answer is: ####N####. 
正确答案: N-position

If a line outside a plane is parallel to a line inside the plane, then the line is ____ to the plane.  

模型回答: To fill in the blank, we need to recall some basic geometry concepts:

1. If a line is parallel to a plane, then the line is said to be parallel to the plane.
2. If a line is parallel to a plane, it means the line never intersects the plane and remains at a fixed distance from it.

Therefore, if a line outside a plane is parallel to a line inside the plane, we can conclude that the line is parallel to the plane.

Hence, the line is ####parallel#### to the plane.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If two angles are each supplementary to two equal angles respectively, then the two angles are ____.

模型回答: Step 1: Let the two equal angles be x and x, and the two supplementary angles be y and z.

Step 2: According to the question, y and x are supplementary, and z and x are supplementary. This means that:

y + x = 180 (supplementary angles)
z + x = 180 (supplementary angles)

Step 3: Since x and x are equal, we can replace x in the equations above with x, resulting in:

y + x = 180
z + x = 180

Step 4: To find the relationship between y and z, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

(y + x) - (z + x) = 180 - 180
y - z = 0
y = z

Step 5: This shows that the two angles y and z are equal when they are supplementary to two equal angles x and x.

Therefore, the two angles are ####equal to each other####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If the hundreds, tens, and units digits of a three-digit number are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively, then the number is ____ + \(10b\) + \(c\).  

模型回答: Let's break down the statement step by step:

1. The number has three digits, so it can be represented as \(abc\).
2. The hundreds digit is \(a\), the tens digit is \(b\), and the units digit is \(c\).
3. According to the question, the number can be expressed as follows: \(abc = ____ + 10b + c\).

To find out the missing digits to complete the sum, we notice the following:

- \(a\) is the hundreds digit, so it occupies the leftmost position in the hundreds place.
- Similarly, \(b\) is the tens digit, so it occupies the middle position in the tens place.
- \(c\) is the units digit, so it occupies the rightmost position in the units place.

Thus, by understanding the positioning of the digits, we can deduce that the missing part of the expression to complete the sum is the \(10a\) term, where \(a\) represents the hundreds digit.

Therefore, the calculation will be as follows:
\[ abc = 100a + 10b + c \]

Hence, the final answer is: ####100a####. 
正确答案: \(100a\)

In a right triangle, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the ____.  

模型回答: In a right triangle, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the ____.  

Let's denote the leg of the right triangle as \( a \), the projection of the leg on the hypotenuse as \( x \), and the other leg of the right triangle as \( b \). According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

The projection of the leg on the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into two segments. Let's denote the segment next to the leg as \( x \) and the other segment as \( c - x \). We can set up proportions to relate the leg, its projection on the hypotenuse, and the segments of the hypotenuse:

\( \frac{a}{x} = \frac{b}{c-x} \)

Cross multiplying gives us:

\( ac - ax = bx \)

Rearranging the terms gives us:

\( ac = (a + b)x \)

Given that the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the expression we derived above:

\( a^2 = x(a + b) \)

Solving for x gives us:

\( x = \frac{a^2}{a + b} \)

Therefore, the final answer is ####a^2 / (a + b)####.
