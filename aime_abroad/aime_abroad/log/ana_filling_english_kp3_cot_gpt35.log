1. Let the two positive numbers be a and b.
2. The logarithm of the product of these two numbers is log(ab).
3. The right side of the equation states that it's equal to the sum of the logarithms of the two numbers with the same base.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Suppose a function \( f(x) \) is differentiable at point \( x_0 \), and \( x_0 \) is an extreme point (maximum point or minimum point) of \( f(x) \), then \( f'(x_0) = \)____.  

模型回答: In this case, since \( x_0 \) is an extreme point of \( f(x) \), it means that the derivative \( f'(x) \) must be equal to zero at that point. This is because at an extreme point, the slope of the tangent line (derivative) is zero.

Therefore, if \( x_0 \) is an extreme point of the function \( f(x) \) and \( f(x) \) is differentiable at \( x_0 \), then \( f'(x_0) = \) ####0####.

The multiplicative group \( \text{GF}(q)^* = \text{GF}(q) \setminus \{0\} \) consisting of the non-zero elements of any finite field \( \text{GF}(q) \) (where \( q = p^n \), \( p \) is a prime number, and \( n \geq 1 \)) is ____.  

模型回答: To fill in the blank, we need to determine the number of elements in the multiplicative group \( \text{GF}(q)^* = \text{GF}(q) \setminus \{0\} \) of a finite field \( \text{GF}(q) \) where \( q = p^n \), \( p \) is a prime number, and \( n \geq 1 \).

The number of elements in a finite field \( \text{GF}(q) \) is equal to \( q \). Since we are excluding the element \( 0 \), the number of elements in the multiplicative group \( \text{GF}(q)^* \) is \( q - 1 \).

In this case, to identify the missing value for \( k \) that satisfies the symmetry condition, we substitute \( n-k \) for the missing value.

Thus, the missing value to complete the symmetry condition for binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{\text{missing value}} \) is ####\( n-k\)####.

- The angle bisector of the vertex angle divides the opposite side into two segments of equal length.
- The median on the base divides the base into two equal segments.
- The altitude on the base is perpendicular to the base and divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles.

If \( k \) elements are selected from \( n \) distinct elements for arrangement, and repeated selection of elements is allowed (i.e., the same element can be selected multiple times), then the number of arrangements is ____.  

模型回答: To find the number of arrangements when \( k \) elements are selected from \( n \) distinct elements with repeated selection allowed, we need to use the concept of permutations with repetition.

The number of ways to select an element for each position when repetitions are allowed is the same as when repetitions are not allowed, which is simply \( n \) for each position.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is given by \( n^k \).

Choose an equation with relatively simple coefficients from the system of equations, express one unknown in terms of an algebraic expression containing the other unknown, then substitute it into the other equation to eliminate one unknown and convert the system into a linear equation in one variable. This solution method is usually called ____.  

模型回答: The solution method you are describing is called the "substitution method" in solving systems of equations.

Let's start with a simple system of equations:
\[ 2x + 3y = 8 \]
\[ 4x - 5y = 6 \]

First, let's express \( x \) from the first equation in terms of \( y \):
\[ 2x = 8 - 3y \]
\[ x = \frac{8 - 3y}{2} = 4 - \frac{3y}{2} \]

By substituting this expression for \( x \) into the second equation:
\[ 4\left(4 - \frac{3y}{2}\right) - 5y = 6 \]
\[ 16 - 6y - 5y = 6 \]
\[ 16 - 11y = 6 \]
\[ -11y = -10 \]
\[ y = 0.909090909 \]

So, the final answer is: 
####0.909090909####

When a line is parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects the other two sides (or their extensions), it creates segments that are proportional. This is known as the Parallel Side Theorem.

According to the Parallel Side Theorem, the corresponding segments created by the parallel line are proportional to the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Therefore, the corresponding segments are divided proportionally.

For any three finite sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the number of elements in their union is equal to the sum of the number of elements in the three sets, minus the sum of the number of elements in all pairwise intersections, and then ____ the number of elements in the intersection of the three sets.

模型回答: Let's denote the number of elements in the sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) as \( |A| \), \( |B| \), and \( |C| \), respectively.

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of elements in the union of these three sets (\( A \cup B \cup C \)) can be calculated as follows:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

Therefore, the final expression is:

The two diagonals of a rectangle are ____ in length.

模型回答: Step 1: 
In a rectangle, the diagonals form a right angle, and they bisect each other. This means that we can consider the rectangle as consisting of two right triangles. 

Step 2:
Let's consider a rectangle with sides of length a and b. The diagonals of this rectangle would be the hypotenuses of the two right triangles formed. 

Step 3:
By using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the diagonals. The diagonal length can be found using the formula: 
Diagonal length = √(a^2 + b^2)

Step 4:
Since the sides of a rectangle are perpendicular, a and b are the sides of the right triangle and they are also the legs of the right triangle. Substituting a and b into the formula gives us the diagonal length for a rectangle.

Step 5:
Therefore, the two diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length. Hence, the answer is ####equal####.
