1. The question concerns logarithms and the product of two positive numbers.
2. The logarithm property for the product of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with the same base is:
   \[
   \log_b(ab) = \log_b(a) + \log_b(b)

3. It asks how to compute the Grundy number of the total game from the Grundy numbers of its independent subgames.

模型回答: Let's analyze the given equation step by step:

Given:
\[
a^b = N
\]

We are asked to solve for \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( N \).

**Step 1: Isolate the exponent**

To solve for \( b \), we can take the logarithm of both sides. Let's use the natural logarithm (though any logarithm base would work):

\[
\ln(a^b) = \ln(N)
\]

**Step 2: Use logarithm properties**

Recall that \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\):

\[
b \ln(a) = \ln(N)
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( b \)**

Divide both sides by \( \ln(a) \) (assuming \( a > 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \)):

\[
b = \frac{\ln(N)}{\ln(a)}
\]

Alternatively, using the definition of logarithms, \( b = \log_a(N) \), since \( a^b = N \implies b = \log_a N \).

Thus, the answer is:
####\(\frac{\ln N}{\ln a}\)####

Or, if a base-\(a\) logarithm is allowed:
####\(\log_a N\)####

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. A complex number is given as \( z = a + bi \), where:
   - \( a \) is the real part.
   - \( b \) is the imaginary part.
   - \( i \) is the imaginary unit, where \( i^2 = -1 \).

2. The modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number \( z \), denoted as \( |z| \), is defined as the distance from the origin to the point \( (a, b) \) in the complex plane.

3. The formula for the modulus of \( z = a + bi \) is:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]

Therefore, the answer is ####\(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)####.

模型回答: Let's analyze the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which is also known as the "mirror" or "complement" property.

The binomial coefficient is defined as:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Now, let's consider \(\binom{n}{n-k}\):
\[
\binom{n}{n-k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
\]
Notice that this is exactly the same as \(\binom{n}{k}\), just that the order of the denominators \(k!\) and \((n-k)!\) is switched, which does not affect the value.

Therefore, the binomial coefficient satisfies the symmetry:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}
\]

So, the blank should be filled with \(n-k\).

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We're asked about the formula for the number of elements in the union of three finite sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). This is related to the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.

The formula is:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |C \cap A| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]

Let's break it down:

1. First, add the sizes of the three sets: \( |A| + |B| + |C| \).
2. Subtract the sizes of the pairwise intersections: \( |A \cap B|, |B \cap C|, |C \cap A| \).
3. Finally, **add** back the size of the intersection of all three (\( |A \cap B \cap C| \)), because it was subtracted out too many times in the previous step.

The blank in the sentence is asking, after subtracting the pairwise intersections, what do we do with the number of elements in the intersection of all three sets? According to the formula, we **add** it.

So, the final answer is:

####add####

模型回答: Let’s analyze the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the nth roots of unity**

The nth roots of unity are the complex numbers that satisfy the equation:  
zⁿ = 1

The nth roots of unity are:  
1, ω, ω², ω³, ..., ωⁿ⁻¹  
where ω = exp(2πi/n) is a primitive nth root of unity.

**Step 2: Representing the sum**

The sum S is:  
S = 1 + ω + ω² + ... + ωⁿ⁻¹

**Step 3: Calculating the sum**

This is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio ω, and with n terms:
S = [1 - ωⁿ] / [1 - ω]

But ωⁿ = (exp(2πi/n))ⁿ = exp(2πi) = 1  
So, S = [1 - 1] / [1 - ω] = 0 / (1 - ω) = 0

**Step 4: Final Answer**

So, the sum of all nth roots of unity is ####0####.
