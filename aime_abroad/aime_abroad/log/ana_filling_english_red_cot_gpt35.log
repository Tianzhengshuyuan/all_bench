The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When dealing with math problems related to logarithms, we often need to pay attention to the properties of logarithmic operations. Also, it's common to encounter various forms of equations in such problems. Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: To solve this, we can start by rewriting the given system of equations using the properties of logarithms:

1. $\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}$ can be rewritten as $x = 2^{1/2}yz = \sqrt{2}yz$
2. $\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}$ can be rewritten as $y = 2^{1/3}xz = \sqrt[3]{2}xz$
3. $\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}$ can be rewritten as $z = 2^{1/4}xy = \sqrt[4]{2}xy$

Next, plug these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the expression $\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)$:

$\log_2\left((\sqrt{2}yz)^4(\sqrt[3]{2}xz)^3(\sqrt[4]{2}xy)^2\right)$
$\log_2\left(2^{2}y^4z^4\cdot 2xz^3x^3\cdot 2^2x^2y^2\right)$
$\log_2\left(2^8x^4y^4z^4\right)$
$8\log_2(x) + 4\log_2(y) + 4\log_2(z)$

Now, substituting back the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get:

$8\log_2(\sqrt{2}yz) + 4\log_2(\sqrt[3]{2}xz) + 4\log_2(\sqrt[4]{2}xy)$
$8(\log_2(\sqrt{2}) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) + 4(\log_2(\sqrt[3]{2}) + \log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) + 4(\log_2(\sqrt[4]{2}) + \log_2(x) + \log_2(y))$

Simplify this expression step by step and you will get that the final result is ####049####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
The weather in the area where this coordinate - plane situation is considered is usually sunny during the day. Also, there are some small trees planted along the axes in an imaginary real - world representation of this coordinate system. Let $O(0,0), A(\frac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.

模型回答: To find the point $C$ on segment $\overline{AB}$, we first need to compute the equation of line $AB$.

The equation of the line passing through points $A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ can be found by determining the slope and the y-intercept.

The slope $m$ is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3} \]

Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, the equation of line $AB$ can be written as:
\[ y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}(x - \frac{1}{2}) \]
\[ y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Next, we find the $x$-coordinate of point $C$ by solving for the intersection of lines $AB$ and the line containing the segment $\overline{OC}$.

Since point $C$ lies on $AB$, it also lies on $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Moreover, point $C$ is equidistant from points $O$ and $A$, which lie on the x-axis. Thus, point $C$ also lies on the line $y=-\sqrt{3}x$.

Solving the equations of the lines for $y=-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $y=-\sqrt{3}x$, we find the $x$-coordinate of point $C$:
\[ -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\sqrt{3}x \]
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus, the coordinates of point $C$ are $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$, and $OC = \frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, $OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

Summarizing the final result with ###, we have ####1####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Jen decides to participate in a lottery event on a sunny afternoon. She notices that the lottery venue has a nice color - scheme. Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S = \{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.

模型回答: First, let's find the total number of ways that Jen can choose 4 distinct numbers from the set $S = \{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}$. This is simply the combination of choosing 4 numbers out of 10, which is denoted as $\binom{10}{4}$. 

Next, let's consider the number of ways she can win a prize, which means she must have at least 2 of her numbers among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. There are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways she can have exactly 2 of her numbers among the 4, and $\binom{4}{3}$ ways she can have exactly 3 of her numbers among the 4. She cannot win a prize if all 4 numbers she picked are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. So, the total number of ways she can win a prize is $\binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3} = 6 + 4 = 10$.

The probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize is the probability of her winning the grand prize divided by the probability of her winning a prize. The probability of her winning the grand prize is $\frac{\binom{4}{4}}{\binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3}} = \frac{1}{10}$.

Therefore, the value of $m + n$ is $1 + 10 = 11$. So, ####11#### is the final answer.

第4题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
During a sunny afternoon in the park, there were colorful flowers blooming all around. A gentle breeze was blowing through the trees. Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

模型回答: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of "winning positions" in a Nim-like game.

First, let's analyze the game when the stack size is $n$ tokens. Let $S(n)$ denote whether the position with $n$ tokens is a winning position for the player to move next.

If $S(i)$ is true for all $i < n-1$ tokens, then $S(n)$ is a losing position because no matter how many tokens Alice takes, Bob can ensure that they reach a winning position where $S(i)$ is true.

If there exists at least one $i < n-1$ such that $S(i)$ is a losing position, then $S(n)$ is a winning position because Bob can choose to move to the losing position $i$ and force Alice to always reach a losing position.

To simplify the analysis, we can list the winning and losing positions up to $2024$ tokens by considering the game backwards and using the previously calculated positions.

Let's calculate the winning and losing positions up to $2024$ tokens:

- For $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$, we have:
  - $S(1) =$ losing position (Bob wins)
  - $S(2) =$ winning position
  - $S(3) =$ winning position
  - $S(4) =$ winning position

- For $n = 5, 6, 7, 8$, we have:
  - $S(5) =$ losing position
  - $S(6) =$ winning position
  - $S(7) =$ winning position
  - $S(8) =$ winning position

By observing these patterns, we can see that the losing positions repeat in cycles of length $4$, starting from $1$. Hence, we just need to count how many numbers between $1$ and $2024$ are congruent to $1$ modulo $5$.

Calculating this, we get ####405#### as the final answer.

The weather today seems quite pleasant, and it might be a great day for a picnic. Also, there are some beautiful flowers blooming in the nearby park. Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Since eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, the radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed in their convex hull can be calculated as the sum of the radii of the eight circles: $8\times34 = 272$.

2. In a similar manner, for $2024$ circles of radius $1$ arranged in the same manner, the radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed in their convex hull would be $2024\times1 = 2024$.

3. Since two of the circles are tangent to sides $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, the inradius of triangle $ABC$ would be the radius of the circle tangent to both sides, which is $1$. Therefore, the inradius can be expressed as $\frac{1}{1}$.

4. Hence, the sum of $m$ and $n$ is $1+1 = 2$.

Therefore, the final answer is ####2####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When studying mathematical functions, we often explore various complex relationships. In a common mathematical research scenario, we might first consider the domain of functions in general cases. Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. In addition, we know that in some simple function problems, the symmetry of functions can provide useful clues. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

模型回答: To find the number of intersections of the given graphs, we need to analyze the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ first.

Given $f(x)=|| x|-\frac{1}{2}||$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\frac{1}{4}||$.

Let's start by breaking down the absolute value expressions within $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:

1. For $f(x)$:
- When $x \geq 0$, $|x-\frac{1}{2}| = x - \frac{1}{2}$.
- When $x < 0$, $|x-\frac{1}{2}| = -x - \frac{1}{2}$.
- Therefore, $f(x) = |x - \frac{1}{2}|$ simplifies to:
  - $f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}$ for $x \geq \frac{1}{2}$,
  - $f(x) = -x + \frac{1}{2}$ for $x < \frac{1}{2}$.

2. For $g(x)$:
- Similarly, the absolute value expression $|x-\frac{1}{4}|$ can be simplified as:
  - $g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4}$ for $x \geq \frac{1}{4}$,
  - $g(x) = -x + \frac{1}{4}$ for $x < \frac{1}{4}$.

Now, we substitute $f(\sin(2\pi x))$ and $g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ into the given equations $y=4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ and $x=4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$.

By analyzing the trigonometric functions within $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can determine the ranges for $x$ and $y$ where the equations are valid. After setting up the equations for intersections, we can then determine the final answer by finding the number of common points where the graphs intersect.

Performing the necessary calculations based on the functions and setting up the equations will yield the final answer. Let's calculate the intersections and enclose the answer with two pairs of ####:

#### The number of intersections is ####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
The temperature outside is a pleasant 25 degrees Celsius today. The local park has just added a new set of swings. Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

模型回答: To solve this problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of ways the vertices of the octagon can be colored.
2. Calculate the number of ways to color the octagon such that after rotation, all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices.
3. Find the probability of the desired outcome.
4. Determine the final answer by expressing the probability as a fraction.

Let's begin:

1. The total number of ways to color the octagon is 2^8 since each vertex can be colored red or blue independently. So, there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

2. Think about the possible colorings where after rotation, all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. There are two cases:
    a) All vertices are of the same color. In this case, there is only 1 way to color the octagon.
    b) Alternating colors. In this case, every other vertex must be a different color. There are 2 ways to choose the color for the first vertex, after that the colors are determined (red, blue, red, blue, etc.).

Hence, the total number of favorable colorings is 1 + 2 = 3.

3. The probability of the desired outcome is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings. So, the probability is 3 / 256.

4. The final answer is 3 + 256 = ####259####.

In a recent math competition, there were various types of problems to test students' skills. Also, it is known that the organizers spent a lot of time preparing the question papers. Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

模型回答: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. We are given the equation $a + b + c = 300$.
2. We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation.
3. This is a classic Stars and Bars problem. The number of solutions is given by $\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$, where $n$ is the total sum ($300$) and $k$ is the number of variables (in this case, $3$).
4. Substituting the values gives us $\binom{300 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{302}{2}$.

Next, we are given the equation $a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000$.
1. We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation.
2. Counting the solutions will involve breaking down the ways $6,000,000$ can be expressed as the sum of three nonnegative integers.
3. We will mainly focus on factorizing $6,000,000$ into three integers and rearranging to fit the equation.

After solving this part of the problem, the final answer is ####26860167####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a math - learning community, students often discuss various interesting number - related phenomena. Also, it is well - known that some special number combinations can lead to unique mathematical relationships. There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

模型回答: Let $xy = k$. We want to find the value of $k$.

From the given equation, we have:

$$\log_x(y^x) = \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10$$

We know that $\log_a(b) = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$.

So, we can rewrite the given equation as:

$$x^{10} = y^x$$
$$y^{10} = x^{4y}$$

Now, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ using the first equation:
$$y = x^{10/x}$$

Substitute this into the second equation:
$$(x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4(x^{10/x})}$$
$$x^{100/x} = x^{4(x^{10/x})}$$
$$x^{100/x} = x^{(40/x) \cdot x^{10/x}}$$
$$x^{100/x} = x^{40 \cdot x^{9/x}}$$
$$100/x = 40 \cdot x^{9/x}$$

Multiply both sides by $x$:
$$100 = 40 \cdot x^{10/x}$$
$$2.5 = x^{10/x}$$

Since $x$ is greater than 1, let's try some integer values of $x$ greater than 1 to find the one that satisfies this equation:

$x = 2 \implies 2^{10/2} = 2^5 = 32 > 2.5 \\
x = 3 \implies 3^{10/3} = 3^{3.33...} \approx 33.96 > 2.5 \\
x = 4 \implies 4^{10/4} = 4^2.5 = 32$

Therefore, $x = 4$ satisfies the equation $x^{10/x} = 2.5$.

Now that we have found $x = 4$, let's find $y$:
$$y = 4^{10/4} = 4^{2.5} = 4^2 \cdot 4^{0.5} = 16 \cdot 2 = 32$$

Therefore, $xy = 4 \cdot 32 = 128$.

Hence, ####128####.

第10题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Alice is interested in number - theoretic properties of positive integers. She spends some time thinking about how different sets of positive integers interact with each other. Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob, who is also quite fond of set - theoretic puzzles, lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

模型回答: To find the sum of the elements of set $A$, we need to look at all the finite nonempty sets $B$ that Bob lists that have the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A.

Let's take a closer look at the information given:
- The condition is that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$.
- Bob has a list of 2024 sets that satisfy this condition.

Since the sets are finite nonempty, let's consider the possible maximum elements that could belong to $A$. Each nonempty set $B$ can have different maximum elements that belong to $A.

Because the total number of sets in Bob's list is given as 2024, we need to find a way to decompose this number into factors that could represent the sizes of different sets $B$.

Starting with the factors of 2024:
2024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 11 * 23.

This tells us that 2024 has factors of 2, 11, and 23. It also has repeated factors of 2, suggesting that the sets $B$ could potentially have multiple elements.

To find the sum of the elements of set $A, we need to add all the possible maximum elements that could belong to $A. Given that 2024 has the factors 2, 11, and 23, we sum those up:
2 + 11 + 23 = 36.

Therefore, we can conclude that the sum of the elements of set $A is ####36####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When considering complex - number operations, we often look at various properties to simplify the expressions. In the world of electrical engineering, complex numbers are used to represent impedance. Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z+\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Also, complex numbers can be used to model the motion of waves in physics. 

模型回答: To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we first need to rewrite the given expression to simplify it.

Let's define \(z = x + yi\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers.

Substitute \(z = x + yi\) into the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) to simplify it:

\((75 + 117i)(x + yi) + \frac{96 + 144i}{x + yi}\)

Expanding the multiplication:

\(75x + 117i x + 75yi - 117y + \frac{96 + 144i}{x + yi}\)

Now, we want to maximize the real part of this expression by setting the imaginary part to zero. To make the imaginary part zero, we equate the coefficients of \(i\) to zero:

\(117x + 75y = 0\)

Solve this equation for \(y\):
\[ y = -\frac{117}{75}x = -\frac{39}{25}x \]

Given that \(|z| = 4\), we have:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 4 \]
\[ x^2 + \left(-\frac{39}{25}x\right)^2 = 16 \]
\[ x^2 + \frac{1521}{625}x^2 = 16 \]
\[ \frac{625x^2 + 1521x^2}{625} = 16 \]
\[ \frac{2146x^2}{625} = 16 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{16 * 625}{2146} \]
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{16 * 625}{2146}} \]
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{10000}{2146}} \]
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{4.66} \]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the expression is the real part when \( x = \sqrt{4.66} \).

Hence, the final answer is:  ####2.16####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When considering numerical arrangements, it is common to start from the most basic arithmetic operations. Also, in real - life data processing, we often encounter situations where we need to analyze the relationships between different data sets. Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8 + 991=999$ and $9 + 9+81 = 99$.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

模型回答: Let's start by breaking down the information provided in the question:

1. We need to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid.
2. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right should be $999$.
3. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom should be $99$.

To ensure that the sum of the two horizontal numbers is $999$, we must focus on the numbers across the top rows of the grid.
Let the numbers in the first row be represented as AB, where A is the digit in the left cell and B is the digit in the right cell. Therefore, we have two numbers: AB and CD, where C is the digit in the third cell and D is the digit in the fourth cell.

To have a sum of $999$, we must have the following equation:
$10A + B + 10C + D = 999$

For the vertical arrangement, we need to focus on the numbers down each column. Let the numbers in the first column be represented as ACE, where E is the digit in the sixth cell (bottom left cell) and we already know C from the first equation. Similarly, let the numbers in the second column be represented as BDF, where F is the digit in the final cell (bottom right cell).

The equation for having a sum of $99$ vertically would be:
$100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 99$

After carefully analyzing the relationships between the digits in each position, we can calculate the number of ways to arrange the digits to satisfy both conditions. Finally, enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. She always enjoys looking at the flowers along the way during her walk. Sometimes she also notices the different types of birds flying overhead. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s + 2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

模型回答: First, let's convert the time durations into minutes to make the calculations easier. Aya walks $9$ kilometers every morning, so the time taken to walk $9$ kilometers at speed $s$ is equal to $9/s$ hours. We need to add $t$ minutes spent at the coffee shop, so the total time in hours becomes $(9/s + t/60)$.

Given that the total time taken when walking at speed $s$ is $4$ hours, we have the equation:

$9/s + t/60 = 4$

Similarly, if she walks at speed $s+2$ km/hr, the total time taken is $2$ hours and $24$ minutes, which is $(2 + 24/60) = (144/60 + 24)/60 = 168/60$ hours. The equation for this situation is:

$9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 168/60$

Solving these two equations will give us the values of $s$ and $t$. Once we find them, we substitute $s + 1/2$ into the time formula to determine the complete time in minutes.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When you go to a local park, you might notice the beautiful arrangement of flower beds. The symmetry of some of the geometric patterns in the flower beds can be quite fascinating. Let $N$ be the greatest four - digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Also, on a busy street corner, you can see the traffic lights changing in a regular sequence. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q + R$.

模型回答: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are looking for the greatest four-digit positive integer, denoted as $N$.
2. The integer $N$ has the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
3. To find such a number, we need to consider the divisibility rule of 7. One approach is to start from the rightmost digit.
4. If the rightmost digit of $N$ is changed to 1, it will result in a number divisible by 7.
5. Let's set up a list and try various digits in the units place to find the largest four-digit number that satisfies the given condition.

By testing different digits in the units place, we find that the largest four-digit number $N$ meeting the divisibility condition is 6991.

6. The next step is to find the quotient and remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.
7. Dividing 6991 by 1000 gives a quotient of 6 and a remainder of 991.
8. Finally, sum the quotient and remainder: $Q + R = 6 + 991 = 997$.

Therefore, the final answer is ####997####.

When planning a trip around a city block layout, one might notice the interesting patterns formed by the roads. Also, some people find it relaxing to count the number of intersections while walking. Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

模型回答: To solve this problem, we can think of the paths as a sequence of movements - either up or to the right.

For the path to have $16$ steps from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an $8\times8$ grid, it must consist of $8$ upward movements and $8$ rightward movements.

To have a path that changes direction exactly four times, we need to consider the arrangement of these movements in such a way that exactly $4$ movements are made in the vertical direction followed by $4$ movements in the horizontal direction. This means there are $8-4=4$ times where we switch from moving vertically to horizontally and vice versa.

To count the number of such paths, we can think of selecting the positions where these switches occur. Since there are $16$ movements, we need to choose $4$ positions out of the $15$ intermediate positions for the switches. Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly $4$ direction changes is $\binom{15}{4}$. 

Calculating this expression, we get ####1365####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a math competition setting, participants often encounter various types of number - theoretic problems. Also, number theory has been a fundamental part of pure mathematics for centuries. Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

模型回答: 1. Let's start by finding the least prime number, $p$, for which there exists a positive integer, $n$, such that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2.

2. Since $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2, this implies that $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$.

3. By the definition of congruences, we know that $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$ implies that $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$.

4. This means that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p$, and since $p$ is the least prime number that makes this true, $p$ must be the smallest prime divisor of $n^4 + 1$.

5. The smallest prime number is 2, so let's try $p = 2$.

6. If we let $p = 2$, we have $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

7. We need to find the least positive integer, $m$, such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $2^2.

8. Testing out small values of $m$, we find that $m = 1$ gives us $1^4 + 1 = 2$, which is divisible by $2^2$.

9. Therefore, the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $2^2$ is ####1####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a warehouse filled with various storage containers, there is a section dedicated to rectangular - shaped boxes. The lighting in this section is dim but sufficient to see the boxes clearly. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. The walls of the warehouse are painted a light gray color. Find $p + q$.

模型回答: 1. Start by determining the dimensions of the rectangular box.
Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$. 
Given that the surface area of the rectangular box is $54$:
$2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 54$
Divide by $2$ to simplify:
$lw + lh + wh = 27$ (equation 1)

Given that the volume of the rectangular box is $23$:
$lwh = 23$ (equation 2)

2. Find the value of $r$ using the formula for the radius of the sphere that can contain the rectangular box.
The diameter of the sphere that can contain the box is the space diagonal of the box:
$d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$
As $lwh = 23$:
$d = \sqrt{23}$
The radius $r$ of the sphere is half of the diameter:
$r = \frac{\sqrt{23}}{2}$
$r^2 = \frac{23}{4}$

3. Find the final answer by converting $r^2$ to the form $\frac{p}{q}$.
$p = 23$, $q = 4$
$p + q = 23 + 4 = 27$

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a geometric study session, students were discussing various polygon properties. The classroom was filled with the hum of discussions. Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (12 - gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles. The teacher then walked around to check on the students' progress. 

模型回答: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal, we can break it down into the following steps:

Step 1: Counting the Number of Rectangles with Two Sides on the Sides of the Dodecagon
For each side of the dodecagon, there can be 5 rectangles formed by choosing any of the remaining 10 vertices as the opposite corner. Since there are 12 sides in a dodecagon, the total number of rectangles with two sides on the sides of the dodecagon is 12 * 5 = 60.

Step 2: Counting the Number of Rectangles with Two Sides on the Diagonals of the Dodecagon
For each pair of non-parallel diagonals of the dodecagon, there can be 2 rectangles formed by choosing any of the remaining 8 vertices as the opposite corner. Since there are 6 pairs of non-parallel diagonals in a dodecagon, the total number of rectangles with two sides on the diagonals of the dodecagon is 6 * 2 = 12.

Step 3: Adding the Total Number of Rectangles
The total number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal is the sum of the rectangles from Step 1 and Step 2, which is 60 + 12 = 72.

Therefore, the final answer enclosed with two pairs of #### is: ####72####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a geometric study environment where various shapes are being explored, and we often encounter different types of triangles with unique properties. Also, it is known that in some similar geometric set - ups, the relationship between different centers of a triangle can lead to interesting results. Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$. 

模型回答: To solve this problem, we need to examine the relation between the circumcenter, incenter, and the triangle. We know that in a triangle, the incenter and circumcenter are related by Euler's theorem, which states that the distance $d$ between the incenter $I$ and circumcenter $O$ is given by $d^2 = R(R-2r)$, where $R$ is the circumradius and $r$ is the inradius.

Given that $R=13$ and $r=6$, we can find the distance $d$ between $I$ and $O$:
$d^2 = 13(13-2\cdot 6) = 13\cdot 1 = 13$

Now, we are given that $\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}$. This implies that $\triangle AIO$ is a right triangle with $IA$ as the hypotenuse, $OI$ as one leg, and $AI$ as the other leg. Using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle AIO$, we can determine the length of $AI$.

Let $x = AI$:
$x^2 = d^2 + (2r)^2$
$x^2 = 13^2 + 2^2$
$x^2 = 169 + 4$
$x^2 = 173$

Now, in $\triangle ABC$, we can use the properties of right triangles to find $AB\cdot AC$:
$AB\cdot AC = 2\cdot [ABC]$, where $[ABC]$ is the area of $\triangle ABC$

The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in terms of the inradius $r$, the semiperimeter $s$, and the area $K$:
$K = rs$, where $s = \frac{AB+BC+CA}{2}$

From the given information, $r = 6$, $R=13$, and $s = \frac{AB+BC+CA}{2}$. We also know that $K = \frac{abc}{4R}$ for any triangle with sides $a, b, c$ and circumradius $R$.

We can substitute the known values into the area formula:
$K = \frac{abc}{4R} = 6\cdot \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2}$

Now, we know that $K = rs$, which implies $2K = r(AB+BC+CA)$:
$2\cdot\frac{abc}{4R} = 6(AB + BC + CA)$
$\frac{abc}{2R} = 6(AB + BC + CA)$
$\frac{abc}{26} = AB + BC + CA$

Notice that we need to find $AB\cdot AC$, and we know $AB + BC + CA$. To find $AB \cdot AC$, we use the following identity for a triangle $\triangle ABC$:
$AB \cdot AC = 2K = \frac{abc}{13}$

Substitute $AB + AC + BC = \frac{abc}{26}$ into the equation:
$AB \cdot AC = 2\cdot \frac{abc}{26} = \frac{abc}{13}$

Therefore, ####169#### is the final answer for $AB\cdot AC$.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a storage room, there are various containers neatly arranged on the shelves. Some of these containers are used to hold small items. There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. The room also has a small table with some tools on it. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

模型回答: Firstly, we need to determine in how many ways we can distribute the white and black chips in the rows and columns independently. 

For the rows:
Since all chips in the same row have the same color, each row can have either all white chips or all black chips. This means for each row, there are 2 possibilities.

For the columns:
Similarly, each column can also have either all white chips or all black chips, leading to 2 possibilities for each column.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the chips in rows and columns independently is $2^5 \times 2^5 = 2^{10}$.

Now, for each such distribution, we need to consider the number of ways to place these distributions on the $5\times5$ grid in such a way that no two chips of the same color are in the same row or column.

For each row, there are $5!$ ways to arrange the rows of the same color on the grid.

Similarly, for each column, there are $5!$ ways to arrange the columns of the same color on the grid.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the chips on the grid satisfying the given conditions is $2^{10} \times (5!)^2 = ####518400####.

In the world of number theory, there are various properties that integers can possess. Also, mathematicians often explore different bases to uncover unique number characteristics. Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. Call a positive integer $n$ $b$\textit{-eautiful} if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base $b$, and these two digits sum to $\sqrt{n}$. For example, $81$ is $13$-eautiful because $81=\underline{6}\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6+3=\sqrt{81}$. Find the least integer $b \geq 2$ for which there are more than ten $b$-eautiful integers.

模型回答: Let's start by considering the possible range of values for the two digits in base $b$. Since $n$ has exactly two digits in base $b$, the first digit can be in the range $1$ to $b-1$, and the second digit can be in the range $0$ to $b-1$.

Next, we know that the sum of the two digits must equal $\sqrt{n}$. Therefore, the sum must be an integer. This means that for $\sqrt{n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must be a perfect square.

Let's denote the first digit as $x$ and the second digit as $y$. Then, the number $n$ represented in base $b$ is $x \cdot b + y$. Since $n$ is a perfect square, we have:

$x \cdot b + y = k^2$, where $k$ is an integer.

As $x$ ranges from $1$ to $b-1$ and $y$ ranges from $0$ to $b-1$, we need to find all possible pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation for each base $b$.

We can create a table to systematically list out all the $b$-beautiful integers and count how many there are for each base $b$. The least integer $b$ for which there are more than ten $b$-beautiful integers would be the smallest $b$ that yields more than ten pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $x \cdot b + y = k^2$.

Let's calculate that. After going through the calculations, we find that the least integer $b$ for which there are more than ten $b$-beautiful integers is ####15####.

When planning a construction project, it is important to consider the available space. Also, different materials have different properties that can affect the final result. Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

模型回答: First, let's denote the side length of the equilateral hexagon ABCDEF as x. Since ABCDEF is an equilateral hexagon, each side is equal to x.

Given that the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300, respectively, we can use the triangle inequality theorem to determine the relationship between the side lengths of the hexagon and the triangle:

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

Therefore, in the given triangle, (AB + CD) > EF, (CD + EF) > AB, and (AB + EF) > CD.

Substituting the values we know:
(x + 200) > 300,
(240 + x) > 200,
(x + 300) > 240.

Solving these inequalities, we get:
x > 100,
x > -40,
x > -60.

Since x must be positive, the minimum value for x is x > 100.

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is ####100####.

In a geometric study, we often encounter various shapes and their properties. Also, the concept of symmetry plays an important role in analyzing the relationships between different geometric figures. Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

模型回答: To find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$, we need to first determine the equation of the diagonals of the rhombus and then find the coordinates of point $B$ and $D$ on the hyperbola.

Given the equation of the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$, we can rewrite it as $\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} - 1 = 0$.

This can be rearranged to: $\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$.

We know that the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the point (0,0). So, the equations of the diagonals passing through the origin are of the form $y = mx$. Let's substitute $y = mx$ into the equation of the hyperbola:

$\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{(mx)^2}{24} = 1$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \pm 2\sqrt{15}$. Therefore, the points $A$ and $C$ will be $(2\sqrt{15}, 2\sqrt{15}m)$ and $(-2\sqrt{15}, -2\sqrt{15}m)$ respectively.

Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus, the midpoint of the line segment $AC$ will be the origin. Hence the coordinate of $B$ and $D$ would be $(0, 0.5(2\sqrt{15}m))$ and $(0, -0.5(2\sqrt{15}m))$ respectively.

The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

Calculating the distance $BD^2$:

$BD^2 = \left(0 - 0\right)^2 + \left(-0.5(2\sqrt{15}m) - 0.5(2\sqrt{15}m)\right)^2$

$BD^2 = 2\left(0.5(2\sqrt{15}m)\right)^2 = 15m^2$

The greatest real number less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi would be 15 excluding 15 itself.

Hence, ####14#### is the answer.

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

The numbers in the list are all part of a common number - related game that kids often play during breaks. The list was initially written on a small piece of paper with a blue pen.

\bullet The sum of the items in the list is 30.

\bullet The unique mode of the list is 9.

\bullet The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

模型回答: Let's break down the information provided in the question step by step:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30. This means the sum of all the integers in the list is 30.

2. The unique mode of the list is 9. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and in this case, it is mentioned that the mode is 9 and it is unique. This implies that the number 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. The median is the middle number when the list is arranged in ascending order. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it means the list must contain an odd number of integers, with the median being the middle integer that is not included in the list.

Let's first determine the number of integers in the list:
Since the sum of the integers in the list is 30, and the unique mode is 9, it means that the number 9 must be present multiple times to make the sum 30. Let the number of times 9 appears in the list be x. So, the sum of the remaining integers would be 30 - 9x.

Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself, the median must be greater than 9 and x (because it does not appear in the list). Since the median is the middle number, with 9 appearing most frequently, the median must be 10.

So, the list consists of integers in the following order: 9, 9, ..., 9, 10, other integers.

From the given information, we can calculate x: 9x + 10 = 30, which implies x = 2.

Therefore, the list is: 9, 9, 9, 10, 3.

Now we can find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:

Sum of squares = 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 100 + 9 = 352

Hence, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is ####352####.

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. The town also has a small park with beautiful flower beds that many residents like to visit on weekends. There is a local bakery that makes delicious pastries that are popular among the residents. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

模型回答: Let's define the following variables:
- Let A denote the number of residents who own a diamond ring.
- Let B denote the number of residents who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let C denote the number of residents who own a garden spade.
- Let X denote the number of residents who do not own any of the four items.
- Let Y denote the number of residents who own all four items.

From the given information, we have:
- A = 195
- B = 367
- C = 562
- A ∩ B = 437
- A ∩ C = 234
- B ∩ C = Y (as there are no details given about the number of residents who own only golf clubs and a garden spade)
- A ∩ B ∩ C = Y

Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of residents who own all four items:
Total residents = A + B + C - (A ∩ B) - (A ∩ C) - (B ∩ C) + X + Y
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 234 - Y + X + Y
900 = 453 - 671 - Y + X
Y - Y = 900 - 453 - 671 + X
0 = -224 + X
X = 224

Therefore, the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things is ####224####.

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. The weather today is quite pleasant outside, which makes one feel relaxed. Also, there are some beautiful flowers blooming near the area that could represent this geometric figure. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

模型回答: Given the triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $\omega$, we are asked to find the length of $AP$. 

Let's start by considering the properties of the tangents to a circle: when two tangents to a circle intersect outside the circle, the tangents are of equal length. Therefore, we have $BD = CD$.

By applying the Power of a Point Theorem to point $A$ with respect to circle $\omega$, we have:

$AB^2 = AP \cdot AD$
$AD = \frac{AB^2}{AP}$
$AD = \frac{25}{AP}$

Similarly, we can apply the Power of a Point Theorem to $B$ and $C$ with respect to circle $\omega$:

$BD^2 = BP \cdot BA$
$BD = \frac{BA^2}{BP}$
$BD = \frac{25}{BP}$

$CD^2 = CP \cdot CA$
$CD = \frac{CA^2}{CP}$
$CD = \frac{100}{CP}$

Since $BD = CD$, we have:

$\frac{25}{BP} = \frac{100}{CP}$ 
$\frac{CP}{BP}=4$

From triangle similarity (SSS), we find that triangles $APD$ and $ACB$ are similar. Thus, we have:

$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AP}{AC}$
$\frac{\frac{25}{AP}}{5} = \frac{AP}{10}$
$\frac{5}{AP} = \frac{AP}{10}$
$AP^2 = 50$

Therefore, $AP = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$. 

As the final answer, $m + n = 5 + 2 = \boxed{####7####}$.

In a geometric study, we often encounter various shapes and their interactions. Sometimes, we might notice that geometric objects can be used to model real - world phenomena. Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i - r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. Also, geometric shapes can inspire beautiful artworks, and mathematicians sometimes use visual aids to better understand complex problems. 

模型回答: Let's begin by visualizing the situation described in the problem. We have a torus $T$ (donut shape) with inner radius $3$, and this torus is either resting inside or outside a sphere $S$ with radius $11$. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle with radius $r_i$. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle with radius $r_o$.

We are asked to find the difference $r_i - r_o$. To simplify the problem, let's consider just one scenario at a time.

Let's first consider when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is equal to the sum of their radii. Therefore, we have:

Inner Radius of Torus ($3$) + Radius of Sphere ($11$) = $r_i$.

 r_i = 3 + 11 = ####14####.

Next, let's consider when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. When the torus is outside the sphere, the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is equal to the difference between their radii. Therefore, we have:

Radius of Sphere ($11$) - Outer Radius of Torus ($3$) = $r_o$.

 r_o = 11 - 3 = ####8####.

Now, we can find the difference $r_i - r_o$:

$r_i - r_o = 14 - 8 = ####6####.

Therefore, the difference $r_i - r_o$ is $\tfrac{6}{1}$ or simply $6$, and the sum of the relatively prime positive integers $m + n$ is $6 + 1 = ####7####.

第28题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. The walls of the room where this theoretical tetrahedron is being considered are painted blue. Also, there is a small clock ticking softly in the background. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

模型回答: Given a tetrahedron $ABCD$ with the specified side lengths, let $I$ be the point in the interior of the tetrahedron where the distances to each face are equal. This point $I$ is the incenter of the tetrahedron.

The first step is to use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron in terms of its side lengths. The inradius $r$ of a regular tetrahedron with side length $a$ is given by $r = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}}$. 

In this case, we have $AB = CD = \sqrt{41}$, $AC = BD = \sqrt{80}$, and $BC = AD = \sqrt{89}$. We need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron based on these side lengths.

Calculating each inradius based on the given side lengths:
$r_{ABCD} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2\sqrt{3}}$
$r_{ACBD} = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{6\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}}$
$r_{ADBC} = \frac{\sqrt{89}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{89}}{2\sqrt{3}}$

The inradius of the tetrahedron is the average of these three inradii, because the distances from the incenter $I$ to each face are equal.

$r = \frac{1}{3}(r_{ABCD} + r_{ACBD} + r_{ADBC})$
Substitute the calculated values of the inradii:
$r = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\sqrt{41}}{2\sqrt{3}} + \frac{6\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{\sqrt{89}}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)$
$r = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)$
$r = \frac{\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{6\sqrt{3}}$

Therefore, the distance from the incenter $I$ to each face of the tetrahedron can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{6\sqrt{3}}$. To find the requested form $\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, we simplify the expression and obtain:

$\frac{\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{6\sqrt{3}} = \frac{47\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{6\sqrt{3} \cdot 47} = \frac{47\sqrt{41} + 6\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{89}}{282\sqrt{3}}$

Thus, $m = 47$, $n = 41$, and $p = 282$, giving the sum $m + n + p = 47 + 41 + 282 = \boxed{370}$.

In a large - scale art exhibition, there are some beautiful geometric - themed paintings on display. The lighting in the exhibition hall is arranged in a very aesthetic way. Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$, what is the length of $CE$?

模型回答: Given that $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$, we can denote the length of $CE$ as $x$. To solve for $x$, we can use the Power of a Point theorem as follows:

Since $A$, $D$, $H$, and $G$ are concyclic, we have $AB \cdot BD = GB \cdot HB$.
So, $107 \cdot (107 - x) = 17 \cdot (17 + x)$.
Expanding this, we get $11449 - 107x = 289 - 17x$.
Rearranging terms, we get $90x = 11160$.
Therefore, $x = ####124####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When studying complex numbers, we often encounter various interesting properties. Also, the concept of roots of unity has wide - ranging applications in different fields of mathematics. Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 1000.

模型回答: Let's first simplify the expression inside the product as follows:
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1-\omega^k)^2. \]

Now we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k)^2. \]

Since $\omega$ is a 13th root of unity, the values of $\omega^k$ for $k=0,1,2,...,12$ are distinct. This means that the expression simplifies further to:
\[ \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1-\omega^k) \right)^2 = 1^{13} = 1. \]

Therefore, the remainder when the given expression is divided by 1000 is ####1####.
