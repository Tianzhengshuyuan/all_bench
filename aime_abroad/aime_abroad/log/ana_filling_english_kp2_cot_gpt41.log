模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step.

**1. Non-terminal position:**  
A non-terminal position is simply a game state where the game is not finished and moves are possible.

**2. P-position:**  
In combinatorial game theory (especially impartial games like Nim), a **P-position** is a position from which the previous player can force a win, assuming optimal play (P for "Previous" or "Previous player wins"). The player whose turn it is to move from a P-position will lose if both play optimally.

**3. N-position:**  
Conversely, an **N-position** is a position from which the next player can force a win (N for "Next" or "Next player wins"). That is, from an N-position, there exists at least one move to a P-position, and thus the next player (the player whose turn it is to move) has a winning strategy.

**4. The question:**  
If a non-terminal position has at least one subsequent position that is a **P-position**, then this position is a ______________.

- Since there exists a move to a P-position, the current player can move to a P-position and win (by always moving to a P-position).
- Therefore, the current position is an **N-position**.

**Final answer:**  
####N-position####

模型回答: Let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. You have a **line outside a plane**.
2. There is a **line inside the plane**.
3. The line outside the plane is **parallel** to the line inside the plane.

Now, consider parallelism in geometry:

- If a line outside a plane is parallel to a line in the plane, it means the outside line does not intersect the plane, because if it did, the intersection point would not allow it to be parallel to the line inside the plane.
- According to geometric rules, a line that is parallel to a line contained within a plane (and is not within the plane itself) is **parallel to the plane** as a whole.

Therefore, the line is **parallel** to the plane.

模型回答: Let’s break the question into parts and analyze it step by step:

1. First, recall what it means for angles to be supplementary:  
Supplementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to 180°.

2. The question says:  
"If two angles are each supplementary to two equal angles respectively…"

Let’s label what we have:  
Let angle A be supplementary to angle C.  
Let angle B be supplementary to angle D.  
Also, angle C and angle D are equal.

So:
- A + C = 180°
- B + D = 180°
- C = D

3. What are A and B’s relationship?  
Since C = D, substitute D for C:
- A + C = 180°
- B + C = 180° (since D = C)

Therefore:  
A + C = 180°  
B + C = 180°

So, A + C = B + C

Subtract C from both sides:
A = B

4. That means A and B are ___________.

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the expression**
   - "Raise \( a \) to the power of" means \( a \) becomes the base.
   - "The logarithm of \( N \) with base \( a \)" is \( \log_a N \).
   - So, the expression is: \( a^{\log_a N} \).

2. **Evaluating \( a^{\log_a N} \)**
   - By the definition of logarithms, \( \log_a N = x \) means \( a^x = N \).
   - So, \( a^{\log_a N} = N \).

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. There is a line \( l \) parallel to a plane \( P \).

2. A new plane \( Q \) is drawn, which passes through the line \( l \), and intersects the original plane \( P \).

3. The intersection of the two planes \( Q \) and \( P \) is a line \( m \).

We are asked: The line \( l \) is ____ the intersection line \( m \).

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Since \( l \) is parallel to the plane \( P \), it does not intersect \( P \) at any point.
- Both the line \( l \) and the intersection line \( m \) are contained in the plane \( Q \).
- The intersection line \( m \) lies in both \( Q \) and \( P \).
- In a plane, if two distinct lines do not intersect, they must be parallel, because in a single plane, two lines are either intersecting or parallel.
- Since \( l \) does not intersect \( m \) (because then it would intersect plane \( P \), which it doesn't), and both are in plane \( Q \), it must be that \( l \) is parallel to \( m \).

So, the final answer is:

模型回答: Let's analyze the Law of Cosines step by step:

**Step 1: Recall the Law of Cosines**

For any triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), where \( \theta \) is the angle opposite side \( c \), the Law of Cosines states:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\theta
\]

**Step 2: Isolate \( \cos\theta \)**

First, move \( a^2 + b^2 \) to the other side:
\[
c^2 - a^2 - b^2 = -2ab\cos\theta
\]

Divide both sides by \( -2ab \):
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
\]

**Step 3: Enclose the Final Answer**

According to the Law of Cosines,
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
\]

So, the answer is:  
####\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}####

When we arrange all \( n \) elements in every possible order, we are talking about counting the number of ways to rearrange all items.

Step 2:
This is a specific case in combinatorics. While "permutation" generally refers to arrangements, specifically, when we arrange all elements (without exclusion), it's called a permutation.

Step 3:
The formal definition is: "A permutation of \( n \) objects is an arrangement of all the objects in a specific order."

So, the answer is:

####permutation####

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Given condition:**
   The points we are looking for in the plane satisfy the property that:
   \[
   | \text{distance to } F_1 - \text{distance to } F_2 | = 2a
   \]
   where \( 0 < 2a < |F_1F_2| \).

2. **Key properties:**
   - The absolute value of the difference of distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant.
   - This constant is less than the distance between the two foci.

3. **Standard definitions:**
   - For an **ellipse**, the sum of the distances to two foci is a constant.
   - For a **hyperbola**, the absolute value of the difference of the distances to two foci is a constant.
   - For a **parabola**, the distance to a fixed point (focus) equals the distance to a fixed line (directrix).

4. **Conclusion:**
   Since the question involves the **difference** (not the sum) of the distances, and it is the **absolute value** being fixed and less than the distance between foci, it must be a hyperbola.

5. **Final answer formatting:**
   As requested, the answer should be enclosed by two pairs of #### symbols.

Therefore, the complete answer is:

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

We are given the equation:

\[
x^n = 1
\]

We are to find, for any positive integer \( n \), how many distinct complex solutions this equation has.

Step 1:  
Recall that in the complex numbers, the equation \( x^n = 1 \) always has \( n \) distinct solutions, known as the \( n \)th roots of unity.

Step 2:  
The solutions can be written as:

\[
x = e^{2\pi i k/n}\,, \quad \text{where } k=0, 1, \ldots, n-1
\]

Step 3:  
Each value of \( k \) gives a different root, and for \( k=n \), we return to \( k=0 \) (since \( e^{2\pi i} = 1 \)), so there are exactly \( n \) distinct complex solutions.

Therefore, the answer is ####n####.
