When dealing with math problems related to logarithms, we often need to pay attention to the properties of logarithmic operations. Also, it's common to encounter various forms of equations in such problems. Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

In a geometric study, we often encounter various shapes and their interactions. Sometimes, we might notice that geometric objects can be used to model real - world phenomena. Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut).

The difference $r_i - r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. Also, geometric shapes can inspire beautiful artworks, and mathematicians sometimes use visual aids to better understand complex problems.
