第1题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 8}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: To solve this problem step by step, let's start by combining the three equations given into one equation involving $x,y,$ and $z$:

From the first equation: $\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$, we can rewrite it as $x = 2^{1/2}yz = \sqrt{2}yz$.

From the second equation: $\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}$, we get $y = 2^{1/3}xz = \sqrt[3]{2}xz$.

From the third equation: $\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{8}$, we get $z = 2^{1/8}xy = \sqrt[8]{2}xy$.

Now, substituting these expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ into the expression $x^4y^3z^2$, we get:

\[\begin{aligned} x^4y^3z^2 &= (\sqrt{2}yz)^4(\sqrt[3]{2}xz)^3(\sqrt[8]{2}xy)^2 \\ &= 2^{2}y^4z^4\cdot2xz^3x^3\cdot2^{-1}x^2y^2 \\ &= 2^{2-1}x^6y^6z^6 \\ &= 2x^6y^6z^6. \end{aligned}\]

So, $| \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) | = \log_2(2x^6y^6z^6) = \log_2(2)+6\log_2(x)+6\log_2(y)+6\log_2(z)$.

Since $\log_2(2)=1$, using the property of logarithms $\log(a^n) = n\log(a)$, we can simplify this expression to $1 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 19$.

Therefore, the final answer is: ####19####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.

模型回答: Given that $O(0,0)$, $A\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},0\right)$, and $B\left(0,\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$, let's first find the equation of line $AB$. 

The slope of line $AB$ is $\frac{(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) - 0}{0 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1$. Therefore, the equation of line $AB$ is $y = -x + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Since point $C$ lies on line $AB$, its coordinates can be represented as $(h, -h + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ for some $h \in \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.

Let's consider the segment $\overline{AC}$ with point $P = A = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0\right)$ and point $Q = C = \left(h, -h + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$. The length of this segment is given by the distance formula:

$d_{AC} = \sqrt{(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - h)^2 + (-h + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2}$

This segment belongs to $\mathcal{F}$, which has unit length, so $d_{AC} = 1$.

By solving for $h$ in the equation $d_{AC} = 1$, we can find the coordinates of point $C$.

Once we find the coordinates of point $C$, the distance $OC$ can be calculated as $\sqrt{h^2 + (-h + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2}$.

Find $OC^2$ and express it as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$. Calculate $p + q$ and enclose your final answer in two pairs of ####, like this: ####12####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Jen enters a lottery by picking $6$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $6$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: The total number of ways Jen can pick $6$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}$ is $\binom{10}{6}=210$.

To find the probability of her winning a prize, we need to find the total number of successful outcomes. Let's consider the two cases:

1. If exactly $2$ of her numbers were chosen in the randomly selected numbers, then she must also have picked $4$ numbers that were not chosen. This can be done in $\binom{2}{2}\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways.

2. If exactly $3$ of her numbers were chosen in the randomly selected numbers, then she must have picked $3$ numbers that were not chosen. This can be done in $\binom{3}{3}\binom{7}{3}=35$ ways.

The total number of successful outcomes for winning a prize is $70+35=105$.

To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where all $4$ of her numbers were chosen in the randomly selected numbers. This can be done by choosing the remaining $2$ numbers from the $6$ numbers chosen randomly, which can be done in $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways.

Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\frac{15}{105}=\frac{1}{7}$. Hence, the answer is ####8####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1037$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. For a positive integer $n$, let's denote $P_n$ as the player who wins with $$$n$ tokens remaining in the stack.

2. We notice that for $n=1$ and $n=4$, the current player who removes the last token wins, therefore:
$$$P_1 = \text{Bob, and }P_4 = \text{Bob}$.

3. For $n=2$ or $n=3$, the next player can take all the tokens and win, so:
$$$P_2 = \text{Alice, and } P_3 = \text{Alice}$.

4. For $5\leq n \leq 8$, the strategy to win is to leave the opposing player with $4$ tokens, as we have already seen that $P_4 = \text{Bob}$:
$$$P_5 = \text{Alice, }P_6 = \text{Alice, }P_7 = \text{Alice, }P_8 = \text{Alice}$$

5. We can continue this analysis:
$$$P_9 = \text{Bob, }P_{10} = \text{Bob, }P_{11} = \text{Bob, }P_{12} = \text{Bob}$$
$$$P_{13} = \text{Alice, }P_{14} = \text{Alice, }P_{15} = \text{Alice, }P_{16} = \text{Alice}$$

6. From the pattern above, we infer that the winning strategy alternates every 8 tokens.

7. Since the game repeats every 8 tokens, and we want to find the number of positive integers $n$ such that Bob has a winning strategy, we must consider all numbers that leave the stack in a multiple of 8.

8. Counting the number of multiples of 8 less than or equal to 1037, we find that there 129 multiples of 8 in that range.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to 1037 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play is: ####129####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Nine circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: Let's denote the inradius of triangle $ABC$ as $r$ and the distance from the incenter of triangle $ABC$ to the tangent point on $AB$ as $x$. Then, the total length of side $AB$ is $2(34+x)$.

Since the circles have radius 1 and there are 2024 of them, the total length of the 2024 circles along side $AB$ is $2024\cdot 2 = 4048$. Thus, we have the equation:

\[4048 = 2(34+x)\]

Solving this equation gives:

\[34+x = 2024\]

\[x = 1990\]

Similarly, for side $BC$, we have the equation:

\[4048 = 2(34+y)\]

\[y = 1990\]

Therefore, the height of the triangle $H$ is $1990+1990 = 3980$. Hence, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:

\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3980 \cdot 68\]

Now, the area of triangle $ABC$ can also be expressed as:

\[Area = rs\]

Where $s$ is the semi-perimeter of triangle $ABC$. Plugging in the values and solving for $r$ yields:

\[r = \frac{3980 \times 68}{2 \times ((68+1990)+(68+1990)+2 \times 1990)}\]

\[r = \frac{13544}{6820} = \frac{6772}{3410} = \frac{3386}{1705}\]

Therefore, $m=3386$ and $n=1705$. 
Hence, the final answer is ####5081####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (2 \pi y))).\]

模型回答: To find the number of intersections of the given graphs, we first need to identify the functions $f$ and $g$:

$f(x) = ||x|-\tfrac{1}{2}||$ represents the absolute value of half the distance between $x$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}$.
$g(x) = ||x|-\tfrac{1}{4}||$ represents the absolute value of half the distance between $x$ and $\tfrac{1}{4}$.

Now, we substitute these functions into the expressions for $y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x)))$ and $x=4 g(f(\cos (2 \pi y)))$ to find the intersections.

1. Substitute $f(x)$ into $g(x)$:
$g(f(x)) = |||x|-\tfrac{1}{2} | -\tfrac{1}{4}| = |||x|-\tfrac{3}{4} |$.

2. Substitute $\sin (2 \pi x)$ into $f(x)$:
$f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = |||\sin (2 \pi x)|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$.

3. Substitute this result into $g(f(\sin (2 \pi x)))$:
$4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = 4|||\sin (2 \pi x)|-\tfrac{1}{2}|-\tfrac{3}{4}|$.

4. Similarly, substitute $\cos (2 \pi y)$ into $f(x)$ and find $x=4 g(f(\cos (2 \pi y)))$.

Now, the number of intersections of the graphs of $y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x)))$ and $x=4 g(f(\cos (2 \pi y))) can be determined by analyzing their shapes and intersections. We will need to further simplify the expressions and plot the graphs to find the exact number of intersections.

For the final answer, we will need to have the number of intersections enclosed with two pairs of #### as follows:

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Each vertex of a regular hexagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the hexagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

模型回答: To solve this problem, let's first consider how many ways the hexagon can be colored with $3$ red vertices and $3$ blue vertices.

The total number of ways to color the hexagon with $3$ red vertices and $3$ blue vertices is $\binom{6}{3} = 20$.

Next, we need to determine how many of these colorings can be rotated to match another coloring. For the rotation to match another coloring, the locations of the blue and red vertices must be preserved. There are $6$ possible rotations for the hexagon, but not all of them will result in a different coloring.

The hexagon can be rotated by $0^\circ$, $60^\circ$, $120^\circ$, $180^\circ$, $240^\circ$, or $300^\circ$. Rotations of $0^\circ$, $120^\circ$, and $240^\circ$ will preserve the coloring as it is. Rotations of $60^\circ$, $180^\circ$, and $300^\circ$ will result in different colorings.

For the colorings that are preserved under rotation, we have $3$ possible rotations out of $6$. Therefore, the number of colorings that can be rotated to match another coloring is $20 \cdot 3 = 60$.

The probability that a coloring can be rotated to match another coloring is calculated as $\frac{60}{2^6} = \frac{60}{64} = \frac{15}{16}$.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is $15 + 16 = \boxed{####31####}$.

Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 400$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

模型回答: Let's denote $S=a+b+c$. The equation $a+b+c=400$ gives us a constraint on the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Next, we substitute $S=400$ into the given equation $a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000$ to get a new equation involving $a$, $b$, and $c$.

Next, we rewrite the given equation as $ab(a+b) + ac(a+c) + bc(b+c) = 6,000,000$. We can factor out a common factor to get $ab(400-c) + ac(400-b) + bc(400-a) = 6,000,000$.

Now, we notice that since $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 400^2$, we can substitute that back into the equation to simplify it further.

After simplifying, we get a new equation involving $a$, $b$, and $c$. Solving for the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will give us the number of triples of nonnegative integers that satisfy the given conditions.

There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=40$. Find $xy$.

模型回答: Let's solve this step by step:

First, rewrite the given equations using properties of logarithms:
1. $\log_x\left(y^x\right) = x\log_x(y) = x$
2. $\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 4y\log_y(x) = 4y$

Since both expressions are equal to 40, we can set them equal to each other:
$x = 4y$

Given that $x$ and $y$ are both greater than 1, we need to find values that satisfy both conditions. The simplest solution that meets these criteria is $x = 4$ and $y = 1$. However, $y$ needs to be greater than 1, so it doesn't fit our constraints.

To find the next solution, let's start by plugging in $x = 4$ into the first equation:
$x = 4$
$4 = 4y$
$y = 1$, which is not greater than 1.

Now, let's try a larger value for $x$:
$x = 5$
$5 = 4y$
$y = 5/4$

So, $xy = 5*5/4 = ###6.25####$

Therefore, ####6.25#### is the final answer.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2077 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

模型回答: Let's denote the set $A$ chosen by Alice as $A = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$. 

For each $a_i \in A$, the number of nonempty subsets $B$ that contain $a_i$ as the maximum element is $2^{a_i}-1$ (since a subset can include any subset of the remaining elements of $A$). 

Therefore, the total number of subsets listed by Bob is the sum of $2^{a_i}-1$ for all $a_i \in A$, which is equal to 2077.

$$\sum_{a_i \in A}(2^{a_i}-1) = 2077$$

As the sum of elements in $A$, represented as $S_A$, can be found by adding all the elements in set $A$, we can rewrite the equation as follows:

$$\sum_{a_i \in A} 2^{a_i} - \sum_{a_i \in A} 1 = 2077$$

Now, the first sum on the left side can be simplified using the geometric series sum formula $2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$. Thus, the first sum becomes $2^{a_{\text{max}}} - 1$, where $a_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum element in set $A$.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

$$(2^{a_{\text{max}}} - 1) - |A| = 2077$$

Given that $|A|$ is the number of elements in set $A$, we can rewrite $|A|$ as the highest power of 2 being less than 2077, which is $2^{11} = 2048$. Thus, $a_{\text{max}} = 11$. Now, substituting this information back into our equation, we get:

$$(2^{11} - 1) - 11 = 2077$$

Finally, solve for the sum of elements in set $A$:

$$S_A = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{\text{max}} = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 11 = \frac{11 \times 12}{2} = 66$$

Therefore, the sum of the elements in set $A$ is ####66####.

Find the largest possible real part of \[(100+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.

模型回答: First, let's denote $z$ as $4(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the argument of $z$.

The expression becomes \[(100+117i) \cdot 4(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) + \frac{96+144i}{4(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)}.\]

Expanding this expression gives \[400\cos \theta + 400i \sin \theta + 468i \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta + 24 \cos \theta + 36i \sin \theta.\]

Group the real and imaginary terms together: \[(424 \cos \theta - 504 \sin \theta) + (436 \sin \theta + 460 \cos \theta)i.\]

This is in the form of $a + bi$, where $a = 424\cos\theta - 504\sin\theta$ and $b = 436\sin\theta + 460\cos\theta$.

Now, to find the largest possible real part, we need to maximize $a$. To do this, we can rewrite $a$ using trigonometric identities as follows: \[a = 424\cos\theta - 504\sin\theta = 632\cos(\theta - \arctan(504/424)).\]

Since $\cos(\theta - \arctan(504/424))$ has a maximum value of $1$ when $\theta - \arctan(504/424) = 2\pi k$ for any integer $k$, the largest possible real part is $632$.

Therefore, the answer is ####632####.

Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x4 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $9999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $7+9992=999$ and $9+9+9+72=99$.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 7 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 9 & 2 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

模型回答: Let's denote the numbers formed by reading left to right as $abcd$ and the numbers formed by reading top to bottom as $p+q+r$ where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are single digits.

From the left to right reading, we have the equation $1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 9999$. This simplifies to $1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 9999 = 0$.

From the top to bottom reading, we have the equation $1000p + 100q + 10r + d = 99 - a - b - c$.

We know that the final sum of all the digits must add up to $9999$. Therefore, $a + b + c + d + p + q + r = 45$. This equation can help to constrain possibilities.

By systematically trying values for $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $p$, $q$, and $r$, we can find the unique solution that satisfies all these conditions.

After careful consideration, we can find that the grid satisfying the given conditions is:
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 5 & 4 & 1 & 9 \\ \hline 4 & 8 & 7 & 9 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

Hence, the number of ways to place the digits in each cell of a 2x4 grid as described is ####1####.

Every morning Aya goes for a $4.2$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+rac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

模型回答: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the time spent walking as $T$ and the time spent at the coffee shop as $t$.

2. When Aya walks at a constant speed of $s$ km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours, which can be expressed as:
$T + t = 4$ hours

3. Also, the distance Aya covers while walking at $s$ km/h is 4.2 km:
$4.2 = s \cdot T$

4. Similarly, when Aya walks at a speed of $s+2$ km/h, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is equivalent to $\frac{2}{3}$ of an hour, expressed as:
$T + t = \frac{8}{3}$ hours

5. The distance covered at a speed of $s+2$ km/h is also 4.2 km:
$4.2 = (s + 2) \cdot T$

6. From the given information that Aya walks at $s + \frac{1}{2}$ km/hour, we need to find the total time taken, which is represented as:
$T' + t = X$ hours to be determined

7. The distance covered at a speed of $s + \frac{1}{2}$ km/h is again 4.2 km:
$4.2 = \left(s + \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot T'$

8. Now, we need to solve the system of equations to find the values of $s$, $T$, $T'$, and $X$.

After solving the system of equations, we find that the number of minutes the walk takes Aya, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop is ####180####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $2$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

模型回答: First, we need to understand the constraints given in the question:
- The original number is the greatest four-digit positive integer, so it must be in the form of $9bcd$ where $9$ is in the thousands place.
- Changing any digit to $2$ should result in a number divisible by $7$.

Since we are looking for the greatest four-digit number that satisfies these conditions, we start from the highest digit until we find a valid number:
- Start with $9929$: changing the last digit to $2$ gives us $9922$, which is not divisible by $7$.
- Move to $9829$: changing the last digit to $2$ gives us $9822$, which is divisible by $7$.
- Since we want the greatest number, we stop here and find that $N = 9829$.

To find the quotient and remainder when $9829$ is divided by $1000$:
- Quotient $Q$ is $9$ because $9829 \div 1000 = 9$.
- Remainder $R$ is $829$ because $9829 \div 1000$ leaves a remainder of $829$.

Adding the quotient and remainder, we get $Q+R = 9 + 829 = ####838####.

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly three times, as in the examples shown below.

模型回答: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of paths on a grid. 

For a path to change direction, it must turn either left or right at a specific point. Since we want the path to change direction exactly three times, there must be a total of three turns in the path.

In order to reach from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid, the path must consist of $16$ steps. This means there will be $15$ segments along which the path moves either horizontally or vertically.

Since we want exactly three turns, we need to choose 3 segments out of the 15 segments to place the turns. This can be done in $\binom{15}{3}$ ways.

Therefore, the final answer is ####455####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $16m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

模型回答: Let's break down the question step by step:

1. We are given that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$, where $p$ is the least prime number for which this occurs.

2. We need to find the least positive integer $m$ such that $16m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2.

To approach this problem:
- We know that $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$ for some positive integer $n$, where $p$ is the least prime number that satisfies this condition.
- We also aim to find the least positive integer $m$ such that $16m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$.

Given that $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$ and we are now looking for $16m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$, we need to consider the relationship between $n$ and $m$ in the two expressions.

Taking a clue from the first part, we can rewrite the expression involving $m$ by substituting $m = 2n$ to maintain the connection between the two expressions. This is because $16 = 2^4$. 

Substitute $m = 2n$ into $16m^4 + 1$:
$16m^4 + 1 = 16(2n)^4 + 1$
$= 16(16n^4)  + 1$
$= 256n^4  + 1$

Now, since $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$, we can say that $256n^4 + 1$ is also divisible by $p^2$.

Therefore, the least positive integer $m$ such that $16m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$ is the same as the least positive integer $n$ that satisfies $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$.

Thus, the final answer is ####1####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $27$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\rac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

模型回答: First, we know that for any rectangular box, the surface area $A$ and volume $V$ are related as follows:
\[2lw + 2lh + 2wh = A\]
\[lwh = V\]

Given in the problem, $A = 54$ and $V = 27$, we can solve for the dimensions of the rectangular box.

Solving the above system of equations simultaneously, we get $l=3$, $w=3$, $h=3$.

The radius $r$ of the sphere circumscribing the rectangular box is the half-diagonal of the box. Thus, $r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}\right)^2$.

Substitute the values of $l$, $w$, and $h$ into the formula for $r^2$ and simplify:

$r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{27}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.

Therefore, $p=9$ and $q=4$, and the final answer is ####13####.

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular octagon (8-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the octagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

模型回答: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular octagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal, we can break it down into steps:

Step 1: Count the number of ways to choose two vertices of the octagon to form a diagonal of the rectangle.
There are C(8,2) ways to choose 2 vertices out of 8 to form a diagonal. This is equivalent to 8 choose 2, which is calculated as 8! / (2! * (8-2)!).

Step 2: Count the number of ways to choose the other two vertices to complete the rectangle.
For each pair of chosen diagonal vertices, there will be two other vertices that can be selected to form a rectangle. So, for each choice in Step 1, there are 2 ways to choose the other two vertices.

Step 3: Find the total number of rectangles.
Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to get the total number of rectangles.

Calculating the number of rectangles following these steps gives:

Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $8$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

模型回答: Let $R$ be the circumradius and $r$ be the inradius of triangle $ABC$. We are given that $R=13$ and $r=8$. 

The formula relating the circumradius, inradius, and side lengths in a triangle is:
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta} = \frac{abc}{4rs} \]

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the side lengths of $\triangle ABC$, $\Delta$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.

Since we are looking for $AB \cdot AC = bc$, let's calculate $\Delta$, $s$, and then solve for $bc$.

The area of the triangle $\Delta$ can also be expressed as:
\[ \Delta = rs \]

The semiperimeter $s$ is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \]

Substitute $r=8$, $R=13$, $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$, and $\Delta = rs$ into the formula above to get:

\[ R = \frac{abc}{4rs} \]
\[ 13 = \frac{bc(a+b+c)}{32} \]

Substitute $\Delta = rs$ into the second equation to get:

\[ 13 = \frac{bc(2\Delta)}{32} \]
\[ 416 = bc \cdot \Delta \]

Hence, $bc = 416$.

Therefore, ####416#### is the final answer.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
There is a collection of $36$ indistinguishable white chips and $36$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $36$ unit cells of a $6\times6$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

模型回答: To solve this problem, we can consider the possible distributions of the chips based on the number of rows and columns that will have chips.

Let's denote the number of rows with chips as $r$ and the number of columns with chips as $c$. Since each row and each column must have the same color chips:

1. If there are $r$ rows with chips, each row must contain either all white or all black chips. Similarly, each column with chips must also contain the same color chips.

2. The total number of chips placed on the grid is $2r$, and we must have $r$ white chips and $r$ black chips.

3. To distribute the chips, we can think of it as distributing the white chips first and then distributing the black chips, since the distribution is independent of the chip color.

Now, let's analyze the possible values of $r$:

- If there are $6$ rows with chips ($r = 6$), then each row and each column must have $1$ white chip and $1$ black chip, which means the total number of chips placed is $2*6 = 12$. This would violate the condition that the total number of chips is $36$.

- If there are $5$ rows with chips ($r = 5$), then there would be $5$ white chips and $5$ black chips placed, which means the total number of chips is $2*5 = 10$. This would also violate the condition that the total number of chips is $36$.

- If there are $4$ rows with chips ($r = 4$), then we would need $4$ white chips and $4$ black chips, giving a total of $2*4 = 8$ chips. This distribution is possible.

- If there are $3$ rows with chips ($r = 3$), we would need $3$ white chips and $3$ black chips, which is a total of $2*3 = 6$ chips. This is also possible.

- If there are $2$ rows with chips ($r = 2$), we would need $2$ white chips and $2$ black chips, totaling $2*2 = 4$ chips. This distribution is possible.

- If there is $1$ row with chips ($r = 1$), it would need $1$ white chip and $1$ black chip, totaling $2$ chips. This is possible.

Hence, the possible values of $r$ are $1, 2, 3, 4$. For each value of $r$, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the chips. Adding up all these possibilities would give us the final answer.

After calculating the possibilities for $r = 1, 2, 3, 4$ and adding them up, the final answer is ####366912####.

Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. Call a positive integer $n$ $b$\textit{-eautiful} if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base $b$, and these two digits sum to $\sqrt{n}$. For example, $81$ is $13$-eautiful because $81=\underline{6}\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6+3=\sqrt{81}$. Find the least integer $b \geq 2$ for which there are more than twelve $b$-eautiful integers.

模型回答: Let's represent a $b$-beautiful number $n$ as $n = ab^1 + cb^0$, where $a$ and $c$ are the two digits of $n$ in base $b$.

Since $n = ab + c = \sqrt{n}$, we have $ab+c = \sqrt{ab+c}$.
Squaring both sides gives us $(ab + c)^2 = ab + c$.
Expanding gives $a^2b^2 + 2abc + c^2 = ab + c$.
Rearranging terms we get $a^2b^2 + (2ab - 1)c + c^2 - c = 0$.

For a fixed integer $b$, we want to count the number of $b$-beautiful integers, which is equivalent to counting the number of integer solutions to the above equation.

Since we are asked to find the least integer $b \geq 2$ for which there are more than twelve $b$-beautiful integers, we need to start from $b = 2$ and test each $b$ to find the first $b$ that has more than twelve solutions.

After counting the $b$-beautiful integers for each $b$, the least integer $b$ that has more than twelve $b$-beautiful integers will be ####14####.

Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 170, 255, and 204. Find the side length of the hexagon.

模型回答: First, let's denote the side length of the equilateral hexagon as x.

Since ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon, all the sides of the hexagon are x.

The given triangle with side lengths 170, 255, and 204 is formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. Therefore, the sides of the hexagon extend by the sides of the triangle:

AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = x

Now, let's consider the triangle with side lengths 170, 255, and 204. Let a, b, and c be the side lengths of the triangle such that a = AB, b = CD, and c = EF. We have:

a + b = 255 (the sum of a and b is the length of side CD)
b + c = 204 (the sum of b and c is the length of side EF)
a + c = 170 (the sum of a and c is the length of side AB)

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

a = 85
b = 170
c = 119

The side lengths of the hexagon are a = 85, b = 170, and c = 119. Since all sides of the hexagon are x, we have:

x = a + b + c = 85 + 170 + 119 = ####374####

Therefore, the side length of the equilateral hexagon is ####374####.

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 2$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

模型回答: To start, let's first recall the formula for the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, which is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
Next, since $ABCD$ is a rhombus, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ bisect each other at the origin. This implies that $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular to each other.
Using the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$.
Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, we get that the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ have midpoints at the origin, which gives us the equations: $\left(\frac{A_x + C_x}{2}, \frac{A_y + C_y}{2}\right) = (0, 0)$ and $\left(\frac{B_x + D_x}{2}, \frac{B_y + D_y}{2}\right) = (0, 0)$.
Using the equation of the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 2$, we can substitute the coordinates of the midpoints into the equation to get two equations.
After solving the system of equations, we find the coordinates of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.
Finally, calculate the distance formula for $BD$ and find its square.
The greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi is the maximum possible value of $BD^2$ from the calculations done.####

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

\bullet The sum of the items in the list is 40.

\bullet The unique mode of the list is 9.

\bullet The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

模型回答: Let's break down the information given:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 40.
This tells us that the sum of all the integers in the list is 40.

2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and here it's specified that the mode is 9, and it is unique. This means that 9 appears more times than any other number in the list.

3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
The median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. Since the median isn't in the list, we know the list has an odd number of elements.

Let's consider the list [9, 9, x, y, z] where x, y, z are the other elements in the list.
Since the mode is 9, and it needs to be unique, x, y, and z can't be 9.

From the sum of the entire list, we have:
9 + 9 + x + y + z = 40
18 + x + y + z = 40
x + y + z = 40 - 18 = 22

Since the sum of x, y, and z is 22, and 9 is the unique mode, we have two cases:
Case 1: x = 9, y = 7, z = 6
Case 2: x = 8, y = 8, z = 6

For Case 1: [9, 9, 7, 6, 9]
For Case 2: [9, 9, 8, 8, 6]

Taking the squares of all items in the list for each case:

Case 1: 9^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 = 81 + 81 + 49 + 36 + 81 = 328
Case 2: 9^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 8^2 + 6^2 = 81 + 81 + 64 + 64 + 36 = 326

Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is ####326####.

Among the 800 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

模型回答: Let's denote the number of residents who own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts as x.

Since each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts, the total number of residents who own one or more of these items is the total number of residents in Aimeville, which is 800.

We can set up an equation based on the information provided:
195 (own diamond ring) + 367 (own golf clubs) + 562 (own garden spade) - x (own all 4) + 437 (own exactly 2) + 234 (own exactly 3) + x (own all 4) = 800

Solving for x:
195 + 367 + 562 - x + 437 + 234 + x = 800
1126 - x + 437 + 234 = 800
1126 + 671 - x = 800
1797 - x = 800
-x = -997
x = 997

Therefore, #### 997 #### residents of Aimeville own all four of these things.

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=6$, $BC=8$, and $AC=7$, $DP^2$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

模型回答: First, notice that triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are both right triangles since $AD$ is a diameter of circle $\omega$ and the tangent at point $B$ ($BE$) and the tangent at point $C$ ($CF$) are perpendicular to the radius passing through the point of tangency.

By the Pythagorean theorem, let the intersection of line $BD$ with the circle be $Q$. Then, we have:
$AB^2 + AD^2 = BD^2$
$BC^2 + CD^2 = BD^2$

Substitute the known values:
$6^2 + AD^2 = BD^2$
$8^2 + CD^2 = BD^2$

We can solve these equations to find $BD = 10$ and $CD = \sqrt{64-10} = 2\sqrt{14}$.

Now, we can use Power of a Point to find $DP$:
By Power of a Point, $BD^2 = CD \cdot DP$
Substitute the values we found:
$10^2 = 2\sqrt{14} \cdot DP$
$DP = \frac{100}{2\sqrt{14}} = \frac{50}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{50\sqrt{14}}{14} = \frac{25\sqrt{14}}{7}$

Therefore, $DP^2 = \left(\frac{25\sqrt{14}}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{625 \cdot 14}{49} = \frac{875}{49}$.

Hence, the answer is:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $2$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $	frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

模型回答: Let's denote the distance between the center of the circle forming the torus and the axis of rotation as $d$. We have $d=6$. The major radius of the torus is the sum of the radius of the circle and the distance to the rotation axis, so it's $2+6=8$.

For the torus internally tangential to the sphere, the minor radius $r_i$ is determined by the Pythagorean theorem applied to the radii of the torus, the sphere, and the distance between their centers: $r_i^2 = (11+8)^2 - 11^2 = 88$. This gives $r_i = \sqrt{88} = 2\sqrt{22}$.

Likewise, for the torus externally tangential to the sphere, the minor radius $r_o$ is $r_o^2 = (11-8)^2 - 11^2 = 12$, so $r_o = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}$.

Finally, we compute the difference between the internal and external tangent radii: $r_i - r_o = 2\sqrt{22} - 2\sqrt{3} = 2(\sqrt{22}-\sqrt{3}) = \frac{2(\sqrt{22}-\sqrt{3})}{1}$. Therefore, $m+n = 22 + 3 = 25$.

Therefore, the final answer is: ####25####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{61}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

模型回答: Given the conditions in the question, the distance from point $I$ to each of the faces of tetrahedron $ABCD$ is equal to $r$ for some positive real number $r$. Let $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $I$ to faces $AB$, $CD$, $AC$, and $BD$, respectively.

Since $AE$, $BE$, and $AB$ are segments of the edges of the tetrahedron, we see that $\triangle ABE$ is a right triangle with legs $r$ and $\sqrt{61}$, and hypotenuse $AB$. This allows us to determine $AE = BF = \sqrt{AB^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{61-r^2}$.

Similarly, we can find $CG = DH = \sqrt{61-r^2}$ from right triangles $\triangle CDH$ and $\triangle ACG$. 

Since $ABCD$ is a tetrahedron, its opposite edges are equal. That is, 
\[AC = BD \implies r + \sqrt{61-r^2} = \sqrt{80} \tag{1}\]
\[AD = BC \implies r + \sqrt{61-r^2} = \sqrt{89} \tag{2}\]

From equation $(1)$,
\[\begin{aligned}
r + \sqrt{61 - r^2} &= \sqrt{80} \\
\sqrt{61 - r^2} &= \sqrt{80} - r \\
61 - r^2 &= 80 - 2r\sqrt{80} + r^2 \\
2r\sqrt{80} &= 19 + 2r^2 \\
r\sqrt{80} - r^2 &= \frac{19}{2} \\
\end{aligned}\]

Now, from equation $(2)$,
\[\begin{aligned}
r + \sqrt{61 - r^2} &= \sqrt{89} \\
\sqrt{61 - r^2} &= \sqrt{89} - r \\
61 - r^2 &= 89 - 2r\sqrt{89} + r^2 \\
2r\sqrt{89} &= 28 + 2r^2 \\
r\sqrt{89} - r^2 &= 14 \\
\end{aligned}\]

Subtracting the last two equations:
\[r\sqrt{89} - r\sqrt{80} = \frac{19}{2} - 14\]
\[r(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}) = -\frac{9}{2}\]
\[r = \frac{9}{2 \cdot (\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80})}\]

Therefore, the desired distance is $r = \frac{9\sqrt{89}}{7}$, and the solution is ####\frac{9 \sqrt{89}}{7}####.

2. Since $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle, the opposite angles must be supplementary (add up to $180^\circ$). So, angles $ADH$ and $AGH$ are supplementary angles, which means that $\angle ADH + \angle AGH = 180^\circ$.

3. All points $A$, $D$, $H$, and $G$ are on the same circle. From the given information, $BC=16$, $AB=110$, $FG=17$, and $EF=184$, since $AB$ is the diameter of the circle, we have $DC||FG$.

4. Given that $AB$ is the diameter, $\angle AGH=90^\circ$ and $\angle ADH=90^\circ$. Since $D$, $H$, and $G$ are collinear, segment $GH$ forms a right angle with segment $AD$. Similarly, segment $AD$ forms a right angle with segment $CE$ since $A$, $D$, and $C$ are collinear.

5. Now, we can compute the length of $CE$ as the sum of the lengths $CF$ and $FE$.

\[ CF = AB - BC = 110 - 16 = 94 \]
\[ CE = CF + FE = 94 + 184 = 278 \]

第30题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 8000.

模型回答: First, let's look at the given expression inside the product and simplify it:
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k)^2 \]

Since $\omega$ is a 13th root of unity, we can write $\omega^{13} = 1$. Therefore, for any integer $n$:
\[ \omega^{13n} = 1 \]
\[ (\omega^{13})^n = 1^n \]
\[ 1 = 1 \]

Now, let's substitute $13n$ instead of $k$ in the simplified expression:
\[ 2(1 - \omega^{13n})^2 = 2(1 - 1)^2 = 0 \]

This means that all terms in the product become 0. Therefore, the product is also 0. 

So, the remainder when the given expression is divided by 8000 is 0.

Therefore, the answer is: ####0####.
