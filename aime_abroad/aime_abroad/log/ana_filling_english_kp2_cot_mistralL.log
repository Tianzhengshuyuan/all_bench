第1题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
What line are the graphs of the exponential function \( y = a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( y = \log_a x \) symmetric about?  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the Functions**:
   - The exponential function is given by \( y = a^x \), where \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \).
   - The logarithmic function is given by \( y = \log_a x \), which is the inverse of the exponential function \( y = a^x \).

2. **Inverse Relationship**:
   - Since \( y = \log_a x \) is the inverse of \( y = a^x \), the graphs of these two functions are symmetric about the line that represents the reflection of a function and its inverse.
   - For any function \( y = f(x) \), its inverse \( y = f^{-1}(x) \) will be symmetric about the line \( y = x \).

3. **Verification**:
   - To verify, consider swapping \( x \) and \( y \) in the exponential function to get its inverse:
     - Start with \( y = a^x \).
     - Swap \( x \) and \( y \): \( x = a^y \).
     - Solve for \( y \): \( y = \log_a x \).
   - This confirms that \( y = \log_a x \) is indeed the inverse of \( y = a^x \).

4. **Symmetry Line**:
   - The symmetry line for a function and its inverse is always \( y = x \).

第2题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
The sufficient and necessary condition for a function \( f(x) \) to be differentiable at point \( x_0 \) is that the left-hand derivative and the ____ of \( f(x) \) at \( x_0 \) both exist and are equal.  

模型回答: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Understanding the question**: The question is about the sufficient and necessary condition for a function \( f(x) \) to be differentiable at a point \( x_0 \). It mentions that the left-hand derivative must exist and be equal to something else for differentiability.

2. **Recalling definitions**:
   - The **left-hand derivative** of \( f(x) \) at \( x_0 \) is defined as:
     \[
     f'_-(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}
     \]
   - Similarly, the **right-hand derivative** of \( f(x) \) at \( x_0 \) is defined as:
     \[
     f'_+(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}
     \]
   - A function \( f(x) \) is **differentiable** at \( x_0 \) if and only if the derivative \( f'(x_0) \) exists. This requires that both the left-hand and right-hand derivatives exist and are equal, i.e.,
     \[
     f'_-(x_0) = f'_+(x_0)
     \]

3. **Filling in the blank**: The question states that the left-hand derivative must exist and be equal to something else for differentiability. From the definitions, this "something else" is the **right-hand derivative**.

4. **Conclusion**: The blank should be filled with "right-hand derivative."

####right-hand derivative#### 
正确答案: right-hand derivative

第3题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Suppose \( A \) and \( B \) are two random events. If \( P(A|B) = P(A) \) (or \( P(B|A) = P(B) \), and \( P(A) > 0 \), \( P(B) > 0 \)), then events \( A \) and \( B \) are said to be mutually ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the Given Information**:
   - We have two random events, \( A \) and \( B \).
   - The condition given is \( P(A|B) = P(A) \) or equivalently \( P(B|A) = P(B) \).
   - Both \( P(A) > 0 \) and \( P(B) > 0 \).

2. **Recalling Definitions**:
   - The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is defined as \( \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).
   - If \( P(A|B) = P(A) \), then substituting the definition of conditional probability, we get:
     \[
     \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = P(A)
     \]
     Multiplying both sides by \( P(B) \), we get:
     \[
     P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
     \]

3. **Interpreting the Result**:
   - The equation \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \) is the definition of **independent events**.
   - When two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

4. **Mutual Property**:
   - The term "mutually" in the context of events often refers to a relationship that holds symmetrically between the events.
   - Since \( P(A|B) = P(A) \) implies \( P(B|A) = P(B) \) and vice versa, the independence is mutual.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The correct term to fill in the blank is "independent."

第4题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If a non-terminal position has at least one subsequent position that is a P-position, then this position is a _____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the terminology**:
   - This question is related to **combinatorial game theory**, specifically the classification of positions in impartial games (like Nim).
   - A **P-position** (Previous-player win) is a position from which the *previous player* can force a win (i.e., the player who just moved). In other words, the player whose turn it is *now* (the next player) will lose if the opponent plays optimally.
   - An **N-position** (Next-player win) is a position from which the *next player* can force a win with optimal play.

2. **Key definitions**:
   - A position is a **P-position** if *all* subsequent positions (reachable in one move) are N-positions. This means no matter what move the current player makes, the opponent can win.
   - A position is an **N-position** if *at least one* subsequent position is a P-position. This means the current player can force the opponent into a losing position (P-position) with at least one move.

3. **Analyzing the question**:
   - The question states: "If a non-terminal position has at least one subsequent position that is a P-position, then this position is a _____."
   - From the definitions above, if a position has *at least one* move to a P-position, it must be an **N-position** (because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position).

4. **Why not a P-position?**:
   - A P-position requires *all* subsequent positions to be N-positions. Here, the condition is weaker ("at least one"), so it cannot be a P-position.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The blank should be filled with **N-position**.

####N-position####

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If a line outside a plane is parallel to a line inside the plane, then the line is ____ to the plane.  

模型回答: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Understand the terms**:
   - A **line outside a plane** means the line does not lie on the plane and is not intersecting it (yet).
   - A **line inside the plane** is a line that lies entirely on the plane.
   - **Parallel lines** are lines that never intersect and lie in the same plane. However, in this case, the two lines are not necessarily in the same plane (one is outside the plane, and one is inside).

2. **Key geometric principle**:
   - If a line (let's call it Line A) outside a plane is parallel to a line (Line B) that lies entirely within the plane, then Line A cannot intersect the plane. If it did intersect the plane, it would have to intersect Line B (since Line B is in the plane), but this would violate the condition that Line A and Line B are parallel (parallel lines never intersect).
   - Therefore, Line A must never intersect the plane, meaning it is **parallel to the plane**.

3. **Definition check**:
   - A line is **parallel to a plane** if the line and the plane do not intersect (i.e., the line does not lie in the plane and never touches it).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The line outside the plane is **parallel** to the plane because it never intersects the plane (as it is parallel to a line inside the plane).

####parallel####

第6题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If the inner function \( u = g(x) \) is monotonically increasing on the interval \( I \), and the outer function \( y = f(u) \) is also monotonically increasing on the corresponding interval \( g(I) \) (the range of \( g(x) \) on \( I \)), then the composite function \( y = f(g(x)) \) is ____ on \( I \).  

模型回答: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - We have a composite function \( y = f(g(x)) \), where \( u = g(x) \) is the inner function and \( y = f(u) \) is the outer function.
   - The inner function \( u = g(x) \) is monotonically increasing on the interval \( I \). This means that if \( x_1 < x_2 \) in \( I \), then \( g(x_1) < g(x_2) \).
   - The outer function \( y = f(u) \) is also monotonically increasing on the corresponding interval \( g(I) \). This means that if \( u_1 < u_2 \) in \( g(I) \), then \( f(u_1) < f(u_2) \).

2. **Behavior of the composite function**:
   - Let \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) be two points in \( I \) such that \( x_1 < x_2 \).
   - Since \( g(x) \) is monotonically increasing, \( g(x_1) < g(x_2) \).
   - Since \( f(u) \) is monotonically increasing, \( f(g(x_1)) < f(g(x_2)) \).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The composite function \( y = f(g(x)) \) preserves the order of inputs because both \( g(x) \) and \( f(u) \) are monotonically increasing. Therefore, \( y = f(g(x)) \) is also monotonically increasing on \( I \).

####monotonically increasing####

第7题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( H \) be a subgroup of \( G \). According to Lagrange's Theorem, the relationship satisfied by the order of \( G \) (denoted \( |G| \)), the order of \( H \) (denoted \( |H| \)), and the number of cosets of \( H \) in \( G \) (denoted \( [G:H] \)) is ________________.  

模型回答: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the terms**:
   - \( |G| \): The order of the group \( G \), which is the number of elements in \( G \).
   - \( |H| \): The order of the subgroup \( H \), which is the number of elements in \( H \).
   - \( [G:H] \): The index of \( H \) in \( G \), which is the number of distinct (left or right) cosets of \( H \) in \( G \).

2. **Recall Lagrange's Theorem**:
   - Lagrange's Theorem states that for a finite group \( G \) and a subgroup \( H \), the order of \( H \) divides the order of \( G \).
   - The theorem also establishes a relationship between \( |G| \), \( |H| \), and \( [G:H] \).

3. **Cosets and their properties**:
   - The cosets of \( H \) in \( G \) partition \( G \) into disjoint subsets, each of which has the same number of elements as \( H \) (i.e., \( |H| \)).
   - Since the cosets partition \( G \), the total number of elements in \( G \) is equal to the number of cosets (\( [G:H] \)) multiplied by the number of elements in each coset (\( |H| \)).

4. **Formulate the relationship**:
   - From the above, we have:
     \[
     |G| = [G:H] \cdot |H|
     \]
   - This is the key relationship described by Lagrange's Theorem.

5. **Final Answer**:
   The relationship satisfied by \( |G| \), \( |H| \), and \( [G:H] \) is:
   ####\( |G| = [G:H] \cdot |H| \)####. 
正确答案: \( |G| = |H| \times [G:H] \)

第8题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If two angles are each supplementary to two equal angles respectively, then the two angles are ____.

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the definitions**:
   - **Supplementary angles**: Two angles are supplementary if their measures add up to 180 degrees. If angle A is supplementary to angle B, then A + B = 180°.
   - **Equal angles**: Two angles are equal if they have the same measure.

2. **Given information**:
   - Let’s denote the two equal angles as angle X and angle Y, so X = Y.
   - There are two other angles, say angle A and angle B, such that:
     - Angle A is supplementary to angle X.
     - Angle B is supplementary to angle Y.

3. **Set up the equations**:
   - Since angle A is supplementary to angle X: A + X = 180°.
   - Since angle B is supplementary to angle Y: B + Y = 180°.

4. **Substitute the equality**:
   - Since X = Y, we can substitute Y with X in the second equation: B + X = 180°.

5. **Compare the equations**:
   - We now have:
     - A + X = 180°.
     - B + X = 180°.
   - Subtract the second equation from the first: (A + X) - (B + X) = 180° - 180°.
   - This simplifies to: A - B = 0, so A = B.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the two angles (A and B) are equal.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
\(\log_a \frac{M}{N} = \log_a M\) ____ \(\log_a N\)  

模型回答: Let's analyze the given logarithmic expression step by step.

### Given:
\[ \log_a \frac{M}{N} = \log_a M \quad \text{____} \quad \log_a N \]

### Step 1: Recall the Logarithmic Quotient Rule
The logarithmic quotient rule states that the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the numerator and the denominator. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[ \log_a \frac{M}{N} = \log_a M - \log_a N \]

### Step 2: Compare with the Given Expression
The given expression is:
\[ \log_a \frac{M}{N} = \log_a M \quad \text{____} \quad \log_a N \]

From the quotient rule, we know that the blank should be filled with a subtraction sign (\(-\)) to make the equation correct.

### Step 3: Verify the Rule
To ensure correctness, let's verify with an example. Let \( a = 10 \), \( M = 100 \), and \( N = 10 \):
\[ \log_{10} \frac{100}{10} = \log_{10} 10 = 1 \]
\[ \log_{10} 100 = 2 \]
\[ \log_{10} 10 = 1 \]
\[ 1 = 2 - 1 \]
This confirms that the correct operation is subtraction.

### Final Answer:
The blank should be filled with a minus sign (\(-\)).

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Raise \( a \) to the power of "the logarithm of \( N \) with base \( a \)", and the result is ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement:
Raise \( a \) to the power of "the logarithm of \( N \) with base \( a \)", and the result is ____.

### Step 1: Understand the Components
The problem involves two main components:
1. **Logarithm**: The expression "the logarithm of \( N \) with base \( a \)" is written mathematically as \( \log_a N \).
2. **Exponentiation**: We are asked to raise \( a \) to the power of the above logarithm, i.e., \( a^{\log_a N} \).

### Step 2: Recall Logarithm and Exponentiation Properties
From logarithm properties, we know that:
\[ a^{\log_a N} = N \]

This is because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations. Specifically:
- The logarithm \( \log_a N \) asks, "To what power must \( a \) be raised to get \( N \)?"
- Raising \( a \) to this power (i.e., \( a^{\log_a N} \)) naturally gives back \( N \).

### Step 3: Verify with an Example
Let’s verify this with an example. Suppose \( a = 2 \) and \( N = 8 \):
1. Compute \( \log_2 8 \). Since \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( \log_2 8 = 3 \).
2. Now raise \( 2 \) to the power of \( 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \), which matches \( N \).

This confirms that \( a^{\log_a N} = N \).

### Step 4: General Proof (Optional)
For a more formal understanding, let \( y = \log_a N \). By definition of logarithms:
\[ a^y = N \]

Substituting back \( y = \log_a N \):
\[ a^{\log_a N} = N \]

### Final Answer:
The result is ####\( N \)####.

Numbers of the form \( z = a + bi \) are called complex numbers, where \( a \) is the real part of the complex number \( z \), and \( b \) is called the ____ of the complex number \( z \).  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The question is about complex numbers, which are typically written in the form \( z = a + bi \), where:
   - \( a \) is a real number.
   - \( b \) is a real number.
   - \( i \) is the imaginary unit, with the property \( i^2 = -1 \).

2. The question states that \( a \) is the "real part" of the complex number \( z \).

3. The blank asks for the term that describes \( b \) in the complex number \( z \).

4. In complex numbers, \( b \) is known as the "imaginary part" of the complex number \( z \).

Thus, the correct term to fill in the blank is "imaginary part."

If the hundreds, tens, and units digits of a three-digit number are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively, then the number is ____ + \(10b\) + \(c\).  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. The question is about a three-digit number with digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.
2. A three-digit number can be expressed as the sum of the values of its digits, where each digit is multiplied by the appropriate place value.
3. The hundreds digit \(a\) is in the hundreds place, so its value is \(a \times 100\).
4. The tens digit \(b\) is in the tens place, so its value is \(b \times 10\) (which is already given in the question).
5. The units digit \(c\) is in the units place, so its value is \(c \times 1\) (which is also already given in the question).

Thus, the number can be expressed as:
\[ a \times 100 + 10b + c \]

The blank in the question should be filled with the value of the hundreds place, which is \(100a\).

The basic relationship in travel problems: Distance = Speed * ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**: The question is about the "basic relationship in travel problems." This typically refers to the fundamental formula used to calculate distance, speed, or time when an object is moving.

2. **Given formula**: The question provides a partially completed formula: **Distance = Speed * ____.**
   This looks like the standard distance formula, which is:
   **Distance = Speed × Time**

3. **Identifying the missing term**: The blank is where the missing term should be. From the standard formula, we know that the missing term is **Time**.

4. **Verification**:
   - Distance is the product of speed and time.
   - For example, if you travel at 60 miles per hour (speed) for 2 hours (time), the distance covered is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
   This confirms that the missing term is indeed **Time**.

第14题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \( f(x) \in \text{GF}(q)[x] \) (the polynomial ring over \( \text{GF}(q) \)) be a polynomial of degree \( d \geq 1 \). Then \( f(x) \) has at most ____ distinct roots in \( \text{GF}(q) \) (with multiple roots counted according to their multiplicities).  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
We are given a polynomial \( f(x) \) over the finite field \( \text{GF}(q) \) (also known as \( \mathbb{F}_q \), the Galois field with \( q \) elements). The polynomial has degree \( d \geq 1 \). The question asks for the maximum number of distinct roots that \( f(x) \) can have in \( \text{GF}(q) \), where multiple roots are counted according to their multiplicities.

### Key Concepts
1. **Polynomial Roots in a Field**: A root of a polynomial \( f(x) \) in \( \text{GF}(q) \) is an element \( \alpha \in \text{GF}(q) \) such that \( f(\alpha) = 0 \).
2. **Degree of a Polynomial**: The degree \( d \) of \( f(x) \) is the highest power of \( x \) with a non-zero coefficient.
3. **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (Analog for Finite Fields)**: Over an algebraically closed field (like \( \mathbb{C} \)), a polynomial of degree \( d \) has exactly \( d \) roots, counting multiplicities. However, \( \text{GF}(q) \) is not algebraically closed, so the maximum number of roots is limited by the size of the field and the degree of the polynomial.
4. **Lagrange's Theorem**: A non-zero polynomial \( f(x) \in \text{GF}(q)[x] \) of degree \( d \) can have at most \( d \) roots in \( \text{GF}(q) \), counting multiplicities. This is because if \( f(x) \) had more than \( d \) roots, it would be identically zero (which contradicts \( d \geq 1 \)).

### Why Not More Than \( d \) Roots?
Suppose \( f(x) \) has \( k \) distinct roots \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_k \) with multiplicities \( m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k \), respectively. Then \( f(x) \) can be written as:
\[
f(x) = (x - \alpha_1)^{m_1} (x - \alpha_2)^{m_2} \cdots (x - \alpha_k)^{m_k} g(x),
\]
where \( g(x) \) has no roots in \( \text{GF}(q) \). The degree of \( f(x) \) is the sum of the multiplicities of the roots plus the degree of \( g(x) \):
\[
d = \sum_{i=1}^k m_i + \deg(g(x)).
\]
Since \( \deg(g(x)) \geq 0 \), the total number of roots (counting multiplicities) is \( \sum_{i=1}^k m_i \leq d \). Thus, the maximum number of distinct roots is at most \( d \) (since each distinct root contributes at least 1 to the sum of multiplicities).

### Edge Cases
- If \( d = 1 \), \( f(x) \) is linear and has exactly 1 root in \( \text{GF}(q) \).
- If \( d \geq q \), the maximum number of distinct roots is still at most \( q \) (since \( \text{GF}(q) \) only has \( q \) elements), but the question is phrased in terms of \( d \), so the general bound is \( d \). However, since \( \text{GF}(q) \) has only \( q \) elements, the maximum number of distinct roots is also at most \( q \). But the question is asking for a bound in terms of \( d \), not \( q \), so the answer is \( d \).

Wait, let's clarify this: The question is asking for the maximum number of distinct roots in \( \text{GF}(q) \), counting multiplicities. The correct bound is \( d \), because a polynomial of degree \( d \) cannot have more than \( d \) roots in any field (including \( \text{GF}(q) \)), counting multiplicities. The size of the field \( q \) does not directly limit the number of roots unless \( q < d \), but even then, the polynomial cannot have more than \( d \) roots in total (counting multiplicities).

However, the question specifies "distinct roots," but it also says "with multiple roots counted according to their multiplicities." This is a bit confusing because if we count multiplicities, we are not counting distinct roots but total roots (with multiplicity). If we interpret it as counting multiplicities, then the maximum is \( d \). If we interpret it as counting distinct roots (without counting multiplicities), then the maximum is \( \min(d, q) \).

Given the phrasing: "with multiple roots counted according to their multiplicities," it means we are counting roots with multiplicity, so the maximum is \( d \).

But the question says "distinct roots" and then clarifies that multiple roots are counted according to their multiplicities. This is contradictory because distinct roots are counted once, while counting multiplicities would count repeated roots multiple times.

I think the intended meaning is: the total number of roots, counting multiplicities, is at most \( d \). The phrase "distinct roots" might be misleading here, but the key is that multiplicities are counted, so the answer is \( d \).

### Final Answer
The polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree \( d \) can have at most \( d \) roots in \( \text{GF}(q) \), counting multiplicities.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
If there are 3 mutually exclusive plans to complete a task, with \( n_1 \) ways in the 1st plan, \( n_2 \) ways in the 2nd plan, and \( n_3 \) ways in the 3rd plan, then the total number of ways to complete the task is ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The question describes a scenario where there are **3 mutually exclusive plans** to complete a task. This means that the plans cannot be used simultaneously—only one plan can be chosen at a time.

2. **Key Concept: Addition Principle (Rule of Sum)**:
   When events or choices are **mutually exclusive**, the total number of ways to complete the task is the **sum** of the individual ways for each plan. This is because choosing one plan excludes the others, so we add the possibilities rather than multiply them.

3. **Given Data**:
   - Number of ways in the 1st plan: \( n_1 \)
   - Number of ways in the 2nd plan: \( n_2 \)
   - Number of ways in the 3rd plan: \( n_3 \)

4. **Applying the Addition Principle**:

If the polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by the linear polynomial \( (x - a) \), the remainder is a constant, and this constant is equal to ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
We are given a polynomial \( f(x) \) and it is divided by a linear polynomial \( (x - a) \). The question asks about the remainder of this division.

### Polynomial Division and Remainder Theorem
When a polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by a linear divisor of the form \( (x - a) \), the remainder is a constant. This is a direct consequence of the **Remainder Theorem**.

The Remainder Theorem states:
> If a polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by \( (x - a) \), the remainder is \( f(a) \).

### Why the Remainder is a Constant
The division algorithm for polynomials states that for any polynomial \( f(x) \) and a non-zero polynomial \( d(x) \), there exist unique polynomials \( q(x) \) (quotient) and \( r(x) \) (remainder) such that:
\[ f(x) = d(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x) \]
where the degree of \( r(x) \) is less than the degree of \( d(x) \).

In this case, \( d(x) = (x - a) \), which is a linear polynomial (degree 1). Therefore, the remainder \( r(x) \) must have a degree less than 1, meaning it must be a constant (degree 0).

### Applying the Remainder Theorem
According to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( (x - a) \) is equal to \( f(a) \). This is because:
\[ f(x) = (x - a) \cdot q(x) + R \]
where \( R \) is the constant remainder. Substituting \( x = a \) into the equation:
\[ f(a) = (a - a) \cdot q(a) + R \]
\[ f(a) = 0 \cdot q(a) + R \]
\[ f(a) = R \]

Thus, the remainder \( R \) is equal to \( f(a) \).

### Conclusion
The remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( (x - a) \) is the constant \( f(a) \).

####\( f(a) \)####

If a line is parallel to a plane, and a plane passing through this line intersects the original plane, then the line is ____ the intersection line.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the given information:**
   - There is a line (let's call it **L**) that is parallel to a plane (let's call it **Plane A**).
   - There is another plane (let's call it **Plane B**) that passes through the line **L**.
   - **Plane B** intersects **Plane A** along some line (let's call this intersection line **I**).

2. **Visualizing the scenario:**
   - Since **L** is parallel to **Plane A**, it means **L** does not intersect **Plane A** and is not contained in **Plane A**.
   - **Plane B** contains **L** and intersects **Plane A** along **I**.
   - Since **L** is parallel to **Plane A**, and **Plane B** contains **L** and intersects **Plane A**, **L** must be parallel to the intersection line **I**. This is because if **L** were not parallel to **I**, it would intersect **Plane A** (which contradicts the given that **L** is parallel to **Plane A**).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The line **L** is parallel to the intersection line **I**.

In a right-angled triangle in a plane, the sum of the squares of the two legs is ____ the square of the hypotenuse.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the question**: The question is about a right-angled triangle in a plane. It asks about the relationship between the squares of the two legs and the square of the hypotenuse.

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

According to the Law of Cosines, \( \cos\theta = \) ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze this step by step.

### Step 1: Recall the Law of Cosines
The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. For a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), and an angle \( \theta \) opposite side \( c \), the Law of Cosines is given by:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos\theta \]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \cos\theta \)
To isolate \( \cos\theta \), we can rearrange the equation:

1. Start with the Law of Cosines:
   \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos\theta \]

2. Subtract \( a^2 + b^2 \) from both sides:
   \[ c^2 - a^2 - b^2 = -2ab \cos\theta \]

3. Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
   \[ a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 2ab \cos\theta \]

4. Divide both sides by \( 2ab \):
   \[ \cos\theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} \]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The expression for \( \cos\theta \) according to the Law of Cosines is:

####\(\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\)#### 
正确答案: $\frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$

Taking all \( n \) distinct elements for arrangement (i.e., "selecting all elements for ordering") is called a(n) ____ of the \( n \) elements.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**:
   The question is about selecting and arranging all \( n \) distinct elements. This is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, where we consider the number of ways to order a set of distinct items.

2. **Key terms**:
   - "Taking all \( n \) distinct elements for arrangement": This implies that every element is included exactly once, and the order matters.
   - "Selecting all elements for ordering": This is another way to say that we are arranging all the elements in a sequence.

3. **Combinatorial concept**:
   When all \( n \) distinct elements are selected and arranged, the number of possible arrangements is given by \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the number of **permutations** of \( n \) distinct elements.

4. **Definition**:
   A **permutation** is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, where the order of the arrangement is important. Since the question specifies "all \( n \) distinct elements," it is referring to a permutation of the entire set.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The correct term to fill in the blank is "permutation."

Any linear equation in two variables (e.g., \( ax + by = c \), where \( a \neq 0 \) and \( b \neq 0 \)) has ____ sets of solutions.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the equation**: The given equation is a linear equation in two variables, \( ax + by = c \), where \( a \neq 0 \) and \( b \neq 0 \). This means both \( x \) and \( y \) are present in the equation, and it is not degenerate (i.e., it is not a vertical or horizontal line where one of the coefficients is zero).

2. **Solving for one variable**: To understand the number of solutions, let's solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   ax + by = c \\
   by = c - ax \\
   y = \frac{c - ax}{b}
   \]
   Here, \( y \) is expressed as a linear function of \( x \). Since \( x \) can take any real value, \( y \) will also take corresponding real values based on the equation.

3. **Infinite solutions**: For every real value of \( x \), there is a corresponding real value of \( y \) that satisfies the equation. Since there are infinitely many real numbers for \( x \), there are infinitely many pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation. Thus, the equation has infinitely many solutions.

4. **Geometric interpretation**: Geometrically, the equation \( ax + by = c \) represents a straight line in the \( xy \)-plane. Every point on this line is a solution to the equation, and since a line extends infinitely in both directions, there are infinitely many points (solutions) on the line.

The two pairs of opposite sides of a parallelogram are respectively ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the question**: The question is about the properties of a parallelogram, specifically focusing on its opposite sides.

2. **Recalling the definition of a parallelogram**: A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel.

3. **Properties of opposite sides in a parallelogram**:
   - The opposite sides of a parallelogram are not only parallel but also equal in length. This is a fundamental property of parallelograms.

4. **Filling in the blank**: The question asks for a description of the two pairs of opposite sides of a parallelogram. Based on the properties, the opposite sides are both parallel and equal in length.

Thus, the most concise and accurate way to fill in the blank is with the word **"equal"** (or **"parallel and equal"**, but typically such questions expect the most distinguishing feature, which is equality in length since parallelism is already implied by the term "parallelogram").

However, in many standard definitions and educational contexts, the blank is often filled with **"equal"** or **"parallel and equal"**. Given the phrasing of the question, it is most likely expecting **"equal"** as the answer, since it is the distinguishing feature beyond just being parallel.

But to be precise, the two pairs of opposite sides of a parallelogram are:
- Parallel (by definition)
- Equal in length

Since the question is phrased as "respectively," it is likely asking for the distinguishing property beyond parallelism, which is equality.

####equal####

(If the question expects both properties, then the answer would be ####parallel and equal####, but typically such questions expect ####equal#### as the answer.)

The locus of points in a plane where the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two fixed points \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) (called foci) is equal to a constant (denoted as \( 2a \), with \( 0 < 2a < |F_1F_2| \)) is called a(n) ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Key Phrases in the Question**:
   - "Locus of points in a plane": This refers to a set of points that satisfy a specific geometric condition.
   - "Absolute value of the difference between the distances to two fixed points \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) (called foci)": This describes a condition involving two fixed points (foci) and the distances from any point on the locus to these foci.
   - "Is equal to a constant (denoted as \( 2a \), with \( 0 < 2a < |F_1F_2| \))": The condition specifies that the absolute difference in distances is constant and less than the distance between the foci.

2. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - The condition \( |d(P, F_1) - d(P, F_2)| = 2a \) (where \( d(P, F) \) is the distance from point \( P \) to focus \( F \)) is the defining property of a **hyperbola**.
   - For a hyperbola, the constant \( 2a \) must be less than the distance between the foci \( |F_1F_2| \), which matches the given condition \( 0 < 2a < |F_1F_2| \).

3. **Comparison with Other Conic Sections**:
   - **Ellipse**: The sum of the distances to the two foci is constant (\( d(P, F_1) + d(P, F_2) = 2a \)).
   - **Parabola**: The distance to a focus is equal to the distance to a directrix (only one focus is involved).
   - **Hyperbola**: The absolute difference of the distances to the two foci is constant, which matches the given condition.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The described locus is a **hyperbola**.

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Context**: The question is about arranging a set of data in ascending or descending order. This is a key step in finding certain statistical measures, such as the median.

2. **Key detail**: The question specifies that the number of data points is **odd**. This is important because the method for finding the median differs depending on whether the number of data points is odd or even.

3. **Definition**: When the data is ordered and the number of data points is odd, the median is the value that lies in the **middle position** of the ordered set. This value separates the higher half of the data from the lower half.

4. **Terminology**: The term that fits the blank is the statistical measure that represents the middle value of an ordered data set when the number of observations is odd. This term is **"median"**.

For any two finite sets \( A \) and \( B \), the number of elements in their union is equal to the sum of the number of elements in the two sets ____ the number of elements in their intersection.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
The question is about the relationship between the number of elements in the union of two finite sets \( A \) and \( B \), the number of elements in each set individually, and the number of elements in their intersection.

### Relevant Concept
This is a classic application of the **Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion** for two sets. The formula is:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Where:
- \( |A \cup B| \) is the number of elements in the union of \( A \) and \( B \).
- \( |A| \) is the number of elements in set \( A \).
- \( |B| \) is the number of elements in set \( B \).
- \( |A \cap B| \) is the number of elements in the intersection of \( A \) and \( B \).

### Breaking Down the Formula
1. \( |A| + |B| \): This sums the number of elements in both sets. However, if there are elements that are in both \( A \) and \( B \) (i.e., in the intersection), they are counted twice in this sum.
2. Subtracting \( |A \cap B| \): This corrects for the double-counting by removing the number of elements that are in both sets.

### Filling in the Blank
The question states:
"The number of elements in their union is equal to the sum of the number of elements in the two sets ____ the number of elements in their intersection."

From the formula, the word that fits in the blank is **"minus"** or **"subtracted by"** (or equivalently, "less" or "minus the"). The most concise and commonly used term is **"minus"**.

### Final Answer
The correct word to fill in the blank is "minus."

   - When two triangles have corresponding sides that are proportional, this is another condition for similarity.
   - If both conditions (equal corresponding angles and proportional corresponding sides) are met, the triangles are similar by the definition of similarity in geometry.

3. **Definition of Similar Triangles**:
   - Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are proportional.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The question is describing the conditions for two triangles to be similar.

In a right triangle, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the ____.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the question**: The question is about a property of right triangles. It states that in a right triangle, the square of a leg (one of the non-hypotenuse sides) is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and something else.

2. **Recalling relevant geometric principles**: In a right triangle, there are several important theorems and properties, including the Pythagorean theorem and the geometric mean theorems (or leg rule and altitude rule). The question seems to be referring to one of these geometric mean theorems.

   - The **Leg Rule** states that in a right triangle, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the length of the hypotenuse itself.

   - Mathematically, if \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs, \( c \) is the hypotenuse, and \( p \) and \( q \) are the projections of the legs on the hypotenuse, then:
     \[
     a^2 = p \cdot c \quad \text{and} \quad b^2 = q \cdot c
     \]

3. **Filling in the blank**: Based on the Leg Rule, the square of a leg is equal to the product of its projection on the hypotenuse and the **hypotenuse**.

4. **Final answer**: The word that fills in the blank is "hypotenuse".

There exists a point inside a tetrahedron that is equidistant from all its faces. This point is called the ____ of the tetrahedron.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the question**: The question is about a special point inside a tetrahedron (a 3D shape with four triangular faces) that is equidistant from all its faces. This is analogous to a concept in 2D geometry where a point inside a triangle is equidistant from all its sides, which is called the **incenter**.

2. **Analogy with 2D geometry**:
   - In a triangle, the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and it is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.
   - Similarly, in a tetrahedron, there is a point that is equidistant from all four faces. This point is called the **incenter** of the tetrahedron.

3. **Verification**:
   - The incenter of a tetrahedron is indeed the point that is equidistant from all its faces. It is the center of the inscribed sphere (insphere) of the tetrahedron, which touches all four faces.

4. **Conclusion**: The blank should be filled with the term that describes this point, which is the **incenter**.

For any positive integer \( n \), the equation \( x^n = 1 \) has exactly ____ distinct complex solutions.  

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
The question asks for the number of **distinct complex solutions** to the equation \( x^n = 1 \) for any positive integer \( n \).

### Step 1: Rewrite the Equation
The equation \( x^n = 1 \) can be rewritten as:
\[ x^n - 1 = 0 \]

This is a polynomial equation of degree \( n \).

### Step 2: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
The **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** states that a polynomial equation of degree \( n \) has exactly \( n \) roots in the complex numbers (including multiplicities).

However, the question specifies **distinct** roots. For \( x^n = 1 \), all roots are distinct because the derivative \( n x^{n-1} \) is non-zero for all roots except \( x = 0 \), which is not a root of \( x^n = 1 \). Thus, there are no repeated roots.

### Step 3: Roots of Unity
The solutions to \( x^n = 1 \) are called the **nth roots of unity**. They are given by:
\[ x_k = e^{2 \pi i k / n} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \]

These roots are distinct because the exponential function is periodic with period \( 2 \pi i \), and the angles \( 2 \pi k / n \) are all distinct modulo \( 2 \pi \) for \( k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \).

### Step 4: Counting Distinct Roots
Since there are \( n \) distinct values of \( k \) (from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \)), there are exactly \( n \) distinct complex roots.

### Verification with Examples
Let's verify this for small values of \( n \):
1. For \( n = 1 \): \( x = 1 \) is the only solution. Number of distinct roots = 1.
2. For \( n = 2 \): \( x^2 = 1 \) has solutions \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \). Number of distinct roots = 2.
3. For \( n = 3 \): \( x^3 = 1 \) has solutions \( x = 1 \), \( x = e^{2 \pi i / 3} \), and \( x = e^{4 \pi i / 3} \). Number of distinct roots = 3.
4. For \( n = 4 \): \( x^4 = 1 \) has solutions \( x = 1 \), \( x = -1 \), \( x = i \), and \( x = -i \). Number of distinct roots = 4.

In all cases, the number of distinct roots is equal to \( n \).

### Conclusion
For any positive integer \( n \), the equation \( x^n = 1 \) has exactly \( n \) distinct complex solutions.
