第1题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let parabola \( C: y^2 = 2px \) (\( p > 0 \)) have focus \( F \). Point \( A \) lies on \( C \). Draw a perpendicular line from \( A \) to the directrix of \( C \), with the foot of the perpendicular being \( B \). If the equation of line \( BF \) is \( y = -3x + 3 \), what is the value of \( |AF| \)?

模型回答: To determine the value of \( |AF| \), we first need to find the coordinates of point \( A \) and the focus \( F \).

- Given: Parabola \( C: y^2 = 2px \) with focus \( F \).
- Since \( F \) is the focus, its coordinates are \( F(p, 0) \).
- Let the coordinates of point \( A \) be \( A(a, \sqrt{2ap}) \), where \( a \) and \( p \) are positive.

Next, we draw a perpendicular line from \( A \) to the directrix, with the foot of the perpendicular being \( B \).

- Since the equation of line \( BF \) is given as \( y = -3x + 3 \), the slope of \( BF \) is \( -3 \).
- Since the line is perpendicular to the segment connecting \( A \) and \( F \), the slope of \( AF \) is the negative reciprocal of \( BF \), which is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Now, we find the equation of \( AF \) passing through point \( A(a, \sqrt{2ap}) \) with slope \( \frac{1}{3} \):

\( y - \sqrt{2ap} = \frac{1}{3}(x - a) \).

Expanding and rewriting in the form \( y = mx + c \):

\( y = \frac{1}{3}x + \sqrt{2ap} - \frac{a}{3} \).

Comparing this equation with the given equation of line \( BF \) \( y = -3x + 3 \), we get:

\( \frac{1}{3} = -3 \) (coefficients of \( x \) should be negatives of reciprocals).

Solving this equation for \( p \):

\( -9 = \frac{1}{3} \)  =>  \( p = \frac{1}{27} \).

The coordinates of point \( A \) are \( A(a, \sqrt{\frac{2a}{27}}) \).

Now, to find \( |AF| \), the distance between points \( A \) and \( F \), we use the distance formula:

\[ |AF| = \sqrt{(a - \frac{1}{27})^2 + (\sqrt{\frac{2a}{27}})^2} \].

Simplify the equation and calculate the final answer.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
For the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\) (\(a > 0\), \(b > 0\)), its left and right foci are \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) respectively. A parabola \(y^2 = 2px\) (\(p > 0\)) with the right focus \(F_2\) as its focus intersects the hyperbola at point \(P\) in the first quadrant. If \(|PF_1| + |PF_2| = 4|F_1F_2|\), what is the eccentricity \(e\) of the hyperbola?

模型回答: Let's denote the left focus of the hyperbola as \(F_1 = (-c, 0)\) and the right focus as \(F_2 = (c, 0)\), where \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

The distance between the foci is given by \(2c = 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

Given that the parabola \(y^2 = 2px\) has \(F_2\) as its focus, the coordinate of the focus of the parabola is \(F_2 = (p, 0)\), where \(p\) is the distance from the focus to the directrix.

Let the intersection point of the parabola and the hyperbola in the first quadrant be \(P = (x, y)\).

The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).

Given that \(|PF_1| + |PF_2| = 4|F_1F_2|\), we have:

\(\sqrt{(x + c)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(x - c)^2 + y^2} = 4\cdot 2c\).

Now, we need to substitute the values into this equation, simplify it, and solve for \(e\), the eccentricity of the hyperbola. Let's work through the calculation steps to find the final answer.

Given that events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, the probability of event \( A \) occurring is \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \), and the probability of event \( B \) occurring is \( P(B) = \frac{1}{3} \). What is the probability \( P(A \cap B) \) of the occurrence of event \( A \cap B \)?

模型回答: To find the probability \( P(A \cap B) \) of the occurrence of event \( A \cap B \) given that events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, we use the formula for independent events:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Given that \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( P(B) = \frac{1}{3} \), we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \]

Multiplying the fractions:

\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6} \]

Therefore, the probability of the occurrence of event \( A \cap B \) is ####1/6####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Xiaotong runs laps on the playground twice a week, running 5 laps or 6 laps each time. The probability of him running 5 laps or 6 laps for the first time is both 0.5. If he runs 5 laps for the first time, the probability of him running 5 laps for the second time is 0.4, and the probability of running 6 laps is 0.6; if he runs 6 laps for the first time, the probability of him running 5 laps for the second time is 0.6, and the probability of running 6 laps is 0.4. What is the probability that Xiaotong runs a total of 10 laps in a week?

模型回答: To find the probability that Xiaotong runs a total of 10 laps in a week, we can break it down:

1. If Xiaotong runs 5 laps for the first time:
    a. The probability of running 5 laps for the second time is 0.4
    b. The probability of running 6 laps for the second time is 0.6

2. If Xiaotong runs 6 laps for the first time:
    a. The probability of running 5 laps for the second time is 0.6
    b. The probability of running 6 laps for the second time is 0.4

Let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:

- Probability of running 5 laps and then 5 laps: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of running 5 laps and then 6 laps: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- Probability of running 6 laps and then 5 laps: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- Probability of running 6 laps and then 6 laps: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2

Therefore, the total probability of Xiaotong running a total of 10 laps in a week is the sum of these probabilities:

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given \( S_n = -n^2 + 8n \), what is the sum of the first 4 terms of the sequence \( \{|a_n|\} \)?

模型回答: First, let's find the general term of the sequence \( \{|a_n|\} \).

For any term of the sequence \( a_n \), the absolute value of the term is given by \( |a_n| \).

The general term of the sequence \( a_n \) is \( a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} \).

So, the general term of the sequence \( |a_n| \) is \( |a_n| = |S_n - S_{n-1}| \).

Substitute \( S_n = -n^2 + 8n \) into the equation to get:

\[ S_n - S_{n-1} = (-n^2 + 8n) - (-(n-1)^2 + 8(n-1)) \]
\[ = -n^2 + 8n + n^2 - 2n + 1 + 8n - 8 \]
\[ = 6n - 7 \]

So, the general term of the sequence \( |a_n| \) is \( |a_n| = |6n - 7| \).

Now, let's find the sum of the first 4 terms of the sequence \( |a_n| \):

\[ |a_1| + |a_2| + |a_3| + |a_4| = |6(1) - 7| + |6(2) - 7| + |6(3) - 7| + |6(4) - 7| \]
\[ = |6 - 7| + |12 - 7| + |18 - 7| + |24 - 7| \]
\[ = 1 + 5 + 11 + 17 \]
\[ = 34 \]

Given that the point \( (3a, 0) \) (\( a > 0 \)) is a symmetric center of the graph of the function \( y = 2\tan\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \), what is the minimum value of \( a \)?

模型回答: To find the minimum value of \( a \), we first need to understand what it means for a point to be a symmetric center of the graph of a function. 

For a point to be a symmetric center of the graph of a function, it means that if you reflect the graph of the function over that point, the graph remains unchanged. In other words, if the point \( (3a, 0) \) is a symmetric center of the graph of \( y = 2\tan\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \), then the graph is symmetric about the vertical line passing through the point \( (3a, 0) \).

The tangent function has period \( \pi \), which means it repeats every \( \pi \) units. The vertical shift by \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) moves the graph to the right by \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) units. Therefore, to be symmetric about the line \( x = 3a \), the distance between the point \( (3a, 0) \) and the vertical asymptotes of the tangent function must be the same.

The vertical asymptotes of \( y = 2\tan\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \) occur at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \), where \( k \) is an integer. So, the distance from \( x = 3a \) to the nearest vertical asymptote on the right side is \( \frac{\pi}{2} - (3a - \frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{5\pi}{6} - 3a \).

Similarly, the distance from \( x = 3a \) to the nearest vertical asymptote on the left side is \( (3a - \frac{\pi}{3}) - (-\frac{\pi}{2}) = 3a - \frac{8\pi}{6} \).

For the point \( (3a, 0) \) to be a symmetric center, these distances must be equal. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{5\pi}{6} - 3a = 3a - \frac{8\pi}{6} \]

Solving this equation will give us the minimum value of \( a \). Let's find it.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given sets \( M = \{x \mid 2x - 1 > 5\} \) and \( N = \{1, 2\} \), what is \( M \cap N \)?

模型回答: To find the intersection of sets \(M\) and \(N\), we need to first determine the elements in each set and then identify the elements that are common to both sets.

Set \(M\) is defined by the inequality \(2x - 1 > 5\):
\[ 2x - 1 > 5 \]
\[ 2x > 6 \]
\[ x > 3 \]

Therefore, set \(M\) consists of all real numbers greater than 3.

Set \(N\) is given as \(N = \{1, 2\}\), which includes the elements 1 and 2.

The intersection of sets \(M\) and \(N\) (\(M \cap N\)) is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the only element common to both sets is 2.

Thus, \( M \cap N = \{2\} \).

Therefore, ####{2}#### is the final answer.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given \( (1 - 2x)^4 = a_0 - 3a_1 x + 4a_2 x^2 - 8a_3 x^3 + 16a_4 x^4 \), what is the value of \( a_0 \)?

模型回答: To find the value of \( a_0 \), we can expand the left side of the given equation \( (1 - 2x)^4 \) using the binomial theorem.

The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) and any non-negative integer \( n \):
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
Where \( \binom{n}{k} \) denotes the binomial coefficient, equal to \( \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).

Applying this to \( (1 - 2x)^4 \), we get:
\[
(1 - 2x)^4 = 1^4 - 4 \cdot 1^3 \cdot 2x + 6 \cdot 1^2 \cdot (2x)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (2x)^3 + (2x)^4
\]
\[
= 1 - 8x + 24x^2 - 32x^3 + 16x^4
\]

Comparing this result with the given equation \( (1 - 2x)^4 = a_0 - 3a_1 x + 4a_2 x^2 - 8a_3 x^3 + 16a_4 x^4 \), we can see that \( a_0 = 1 \).

Therefore, the value of \( a_0 \) is ####1####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Under certain conditions, the time required for an artificial intelligence large language model to train on \( N \) units of data is \( T = k\log_2 N \) (unit: h), where \( k \) is a constant. Under these conditions, it is known that when the training data volume \( N \) increases from \( 10^6 \) units to \( 1.024 \times 10^9 \) units, the training time increases by 20 h; how many hours does the training time increase when the training data volume \( N \) increases from \( 1.024 \times 10^9 \) units to \( 8.192 \times 10^9 \) units?

模型回答: Given that the training time \( T = k\log_2 N \), where \( T \) is in hours, and \( k \) is a constant.

When the training data volume increases from \( 10^6 \) units to \( 1.024 \times 10^9 \) units, the training time increases by 20 hours.

Let's first find the value of \( k \) using the initial data point:
\[ T_1 = k\log_2(10^6) \]  \[ 20 = k\log_2(1.024 \times 10^9) \]
\[ k = \frac{20} {\log_2(1.024 \times 10^9)} \]

Now we need to find out how many hours the training time increases when the training data volume \( N \) increases from \( 1.024 \times 10^9 \) units to \( 8.192 \times 10^9 \) units:
\[ T_2 = k\log_2(8.192 \times 10^9) \]
\[ Increase = T_2 - T_1 \]

Let's calculate the increase in training time.###

第10题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given the general terms of sequences \(\{a_n\}\), \(\{b_n\}\), and \(\{c_n\}\) are \(a_n = 10n - 9\), \(b_n = 2^n\), and \(c_n = \lambda a_n + (1 - \lambda)b_n\) respectively. For any \(\lambda \in [0, 1]\), the values of \(a_n\), \(b_n\), and \(c_n\) can form a triangle. How many positive integers \(n\) satisfy the condition?

模型回答: To find the positive integers \(n\) that satisfy the condition that the values of \(a_n\), \(b_n\), and \(c_n\) can form a triangle, we need to analyze the relationship between the three sequences.

For any triangle with side lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the triangle inequality states that for a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

In this case:
- Side \(a\) has length \(a_n = 10n - 9\).
- Side \(b\) has length \(b_n = 2^n\).
- Side \(c\) has length \(c_n = \lambda a_n + (1 - \lambda)b_n\).

For the triangle to exist, we must have:
\[ c_n + b_n > a_n \]
\[ c_n + a_n > b_n \]
\[ a_n + b_n > c_n \]

Substitute the expressions for \(a_n\), \(b_n\), and \(c_n\) into the inequalities:
\[ \lambda a_n + (1 - \lambda)b_n + b_n > a_n \]
\[ \lambda a_n + (1 - \lambda)b_n + a_n > b_n \]
\[ a_n + b_n > \lambda a_n + (1 - \lambda)b_n \]

Now substitute the expressions for \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) into the inequalities and solve for \(n\).
\[ \lambda (10n - 9) + (1 - \lambda)2^n + 2^n > 10n - 9 \]
\[ \lambda (10n - 9) + (1 - \lambda)2^n + 10n - 9 > 2^n \]
\[ 10n - 9 + 2^n > \lambda (10n - 9) + (1 - \lambda)2^n \]

Upon simplifying the inequalities and solving for \(n\), we arrive at the range of valid positive integers \(n\). Finally, enclose the final answer with two pairs of####.

Given that the complex number \( z \) satisfies \( \text{i} \cdot z + 2 = 2\text{i} \), what is \( |z| + 1 \)?

模型回答: To solve this problem, we first substitute the complex number \( z = a + bi \) into the given equation and then find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

Given: \( i \cdot z + 2 = 2i \)

Substitute \( z = a + bi \):
\( i \cdot (a + bi) + 2 = 2i \)

Expand the left side:
\( ai - b + 2 = 2i \)

Now, separate the real and imaginary parts:
Real part: \( ai + 2 = 0 \)  
Imaginary part: \( -b = 2 \)

From the real part:
\( ai = -2 \)
\( a = 0 \)

From the imaginary part:
\( b = -2 \)

Therefore, \( z = 0 - 2i \), which means \( |z| = \sqrt{0^2 + (-2)^2} = 2 \).

Finally, \( |z| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

Given the universal set \( U = \{x \mid x \text{ is a positive integer less than 9}\} \) and set \( A = \{1, 3\} \), how many elements are there in \( \complement_U A \)?

模型回答: To find the number of elements in the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U, we need to determine the elements that are in the universal set but not in set A.

The universal set \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} \) represents all positive integers less than 9.

Set \( A = \{1, 3\} \) contains elements 1 and 3.

The complement of set A with respect to the universal set U, denoted as \( \complement_U A \), consists of all elements in U that are not in A.

Therefore, the elements in \( \complement_U A \) are {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Given \( f(x) = \sin(\omega x + \varphi) \) (\( \omega > 0 \), \( -\pi < \varphi < \pi \)), which is monotonically increasing on \(\left[-\frac{5\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12}\right]\). Additionally, \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \) is one of its axes of symmetry, and \( \left(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0\right) \) is one of its centers of symmetry. What is the minimum value of \( f(x) \) when \( x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right] \)?

模型回答: Given information:
1. \( f(x) = \sin(\omega x + \varphi) \) is monotonically increasing on \(\left[-\frac{5\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12}\right]\).
2. \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \) is one of the axes of symmetry of the function.
3. \( \left(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0\right) \) is one of the centers of symmetry of the function.
4. We need to find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) when \( x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right] \).

Let's analyze the given information step by step to understand the function \( f(x) \) better:

1. The function \( f(x) = \sin(\omega x + \varphi) \) is monotonically increasing on \(\left[-\frac{5\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12}\right]\).
Since \( \sin \) function is monotonically increasing on \( \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right] \) when the coefficient of \( x \) is positive, we can deduce that \( \omega > 0 \).

2. \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \) is one of the axes of symmetry of the function.
This means that the function is symmetric about \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \). The sine function is symmetric about its point of inflection, which occurs at \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \).

3. \( \left(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0\right) \) is one of the centers of symmetry of the function.
This indicates that the function is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \). Therefore, the argument inside the sine function should be shifted by \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) to make the function symmetric about this vertical line.

Now, let's consider \( f(x) = \sin(\omega x + \varphi) \) with the given constraints:
- \( \omega > 0 \) and \( -\pi < \varphi < \pi \)
- The function is monotonically increasing on \(\left[-\frac{5\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12}\right]\)
- \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \) is the axis of symmetry
- \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the center of symmetry

Given that the function is symmetric about \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \) and \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \), the function can be represented as:
\[ f(x) = \sin\left(\omega\left(x - \frac{\pi}{12}\right) + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \]

Now, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) when \( x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right] \) occurs when the function is at its lowest point within that interval, which happens at the point of symmetry \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \).

At \( x = \frac{\pi}{12} \):
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \sin\left(\omega\left(\frac{\pi}{12} - \frac{\pi}{12}\right) + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) when \( x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right] \) is ####1####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given that \(\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m\) and \(\tan\alpha \tan\beta = 3\), what is \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\)? 

模型回答: To find \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\) using the provided information of \(\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m\) and \(\tan\alpha \tan\beta = 3\), we can use the trigonometric identity:

\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos\alpha \cos\beta + \sin\alpha \sin\beta
\]

To simplify the above expression, we need to express \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\) in terms of \(\cos(\alpha + \beta)\) and the given condition.

Firstly, let's express \(\cos(\alpha + \beta)\) using the sum formula:

\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos\alpha \cos\beta - \sin\alpha \sin\beta = m
\]

Now, rearrange the terms in the formula for \(\cos(\alpha + \beta)\) to express \(\sin\alpha \sin\beta\) in terms of \(\cos\alpha\) and \(\cos\beta\):

\[
\sin\alpha \sin\beta = \cos\alpha \cos\beta - m
\]

Next, let's use the given condition \(\tan\alpha \tan\beta = 3\) to express \(\sin\alpha \sin\beta\) in terms of \(\tan\alpha\) and \(\tan\beta\):

\[
\tan\alpha \tan\beta = \frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\alpha} \cdot \frac{\sin\beta}{\cos\beta} = 3
\]

This implies that \(\sin\alpha \sin\beta = 3\cos\alpha \cos\beta\).

Now substitute \(\sin\alpha \sin\beta = 3\cos\alpha \cos\beta\) back into the formula for \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\) to obtain:

\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos\alpha \cos\beta + 3\cos\alpha \cos\beta = 4\cos\alpha \cos\beta
\]

Thus, the final answer for \(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\) is ####4####

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
When \( x \in \left[0, \frac{2\pi}{3}\right] \), how many intersection points are there between the curves \( y = \sin x \) and \( y = 2\sin\left(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}\right) \)?

模型回答: To find the intersection points between the two curves, we need to set them equal to each other and solve for \( x \). 

So, the equation becomes: 
\[ \sin x = 2\sin\left(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}\right) \]

Next, we can use the trigonometric identity \( \sin 3x = 3\sin x - 4\sin^3 x \) to simplify the equation:
\[ \sin x = 2\sin(3x)\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) - 2\cos(3x)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) \]

\[ \sin x = 2(3\sin x - 4\sin^3 x)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - 2(\cos x \cos 2x - \sin x \sin 2x)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \]

\[ \sin x = 3\sqrt{3}\sin x - 4\sqrt{3}\sin^3 x - \frac{1}{2}\cos x \cos 2x + \sin x \sin 2x \]

This equation simplifies to:
\[ -4\sqrt{3}\sin^3 x + \left(3\sqrt{3} - 1\right)\sin x - \frac{1}{2}\cos x \cos 2x + \sin x \sin 2x = 0 \]

Unfortunately, solving this equation involves finding the roots of a polynomial equation in sin(x) and cos(x) which is quite complex.

We can conclude that there are many intersection points between the curves \( y = \sin x \) and \( y = 2\sin(3x - \frac{\pi}{6}) \) in the interval \( x \in \left[0, \frac{2\pi}{3}\right] \). Since finding the exact number of intersections requires more advanced techniques, the exact number of intersection points is difficult to determine without further analysis.

#### Hence, the number of intersection points is not easily determinable in this case. ####

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given that \( \text{i} \) is the imaginary unit, what is the value of \( \left| \frac{4 + \text{i}}{\text{i}} \right| \)?

模型回答: To find the absolute value of a complex number in the form \(a + bi\), we use the formula:

\[
\left| a + bi \right| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

Given that \( \text{i} = 0 + 1\text{i} \), we rewrite the expression as:

\[
\left| \frac{4 + \text{i}}{\text{i}} \right| = \left| 4 + \text{i} \right|
\]

Applying the formula for the absolute value of a complex number, we have:

\[
\left| 4 + \text{i} \right| = \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: ####\sqrt{17}####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let function \( f(x) = \sin 2\omega x + \cos 2\omega x \) (\( \omega > 0 \)). If \( f(x + \pi) = f(x) \) holds constantly, and \( f(x) \) has a zero point on \( \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4}\right] \), what is the minimum value of \( \omega \)?

模型回答: 1. We are given the function \( f(x) = \sin(2\omega x) + \cos(2\omega x) \), where \( \omega > 0 \).
2. The condition \( f(x + \pi) = f(x) \) means that the function is periodic with a period of \( \pi \). This implies that the function is periodic and repeats its values every \( \pi \) units.
3. To find the zero point of \( f(x) \) on \( \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4}\right] \), we set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ \sin(2\omega x) + \cos(2\omega x) = 0 \]
\[ \tan(2\omega x) = -1 \]
4. The solutions of \( \tan(2\omega x) = -1 \) on \( \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4}\right] \) correspond to the points where \( f(x) \) has a zero.
5. In the interval \( \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4}\right] \), the solutions to \( \tan(2\omega x) = -1 \) are \( x = \frac{3\pi}{8} \) and \( x = \frac{\pi}{8} \).
6. To find the minimum value of \( \omega \), we consider the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition. This occurs when \( x = \frac{\pi}{8} \).
\[ \tan(2\omega \times \frac{\pi}{8}) = -1 \]
\[ \tan(\frac{\pi\omega}{4}) = -1 \]
7. Solving for \( \omega \) gives:
\[ \omega = \frac{4}{\pi}(\frac{3\pi}{2} + \pi n), n \in \mathbb{Z} \]
8. The smallest positive value of \( \omega \) is when \( n = 0 \), giving:
\[ \omega = \frac{4}{\pi}\times\frac{3\pi}{2} = 6 \]

There are 7 male athletes and 2 female athletes. How many different ways are there to select 2 people to form a team for the table tennis mixed doubles match?

模型回答: To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:

nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where:
n = total number of athletes
r = number of athletes to be selected

In this case,
n = 9 (7 male athletes + 2 female athletes)
r = 2 (to form a team)

Substitute n and r into the formula:

9C2 = 9! / (2!(9-2)!)
     = 9! / (2! * 7!)
     = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1)

If $\cos\alpha + 2\sin\alpha = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}$, what is $\tan\alpha$?  

模型回答: Given the equation $\cos\alpha + 2\sin\alpha = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}$, we can square both sides to utilize the Pythagorean identity $\cos^2\alpha + \sin^2\alpha = 1$.  

Squaring both sides gives us:
$(\cos\alpha + 2\sin\alpha)^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)^2$  
$\cos^2\alpha + 4\cos\alpha\sin\alpha + 4\sin^2\alpha = \frac{45}{25}$    
$\cos^2\alpha + 4\cos\alpha\sin\alpha + 4(1- \cos^2\alpha) = \frac{9}{5}$    
$5\cos^2\alpha + 4\cos\alpha\sin\alpha + 4(1 - \cos^2\alpha) = 9$  
$5\cos^2\alpha + 4\cos\alpha\sin\alpha + 4 - 4\cos^2\alpha = 9$  
$-3\cos^2\alpha + 4\cos\alpha\sin\alpha = 5$  

Divide both sides by $\cos^2\alpha$:
$-3 + 4\tan\alpha = 5$  
$4\tan\alpha = 8$  
$\tan\alpha = 2$  

Therefore, ####2####.

3 parents and 3 children go hiking. The 6 people need to line up in a queue, with the requirement that both the head and the tail of the queue are parents. How many different arrangements are there?

模型回答: Given that the head and tail of the queue must be parents, there are 4 parents (3 parents from the given and 1 more to choose for either the head or the tail).

For the two remaining spots in the queue, there are 3 children left to choose from.

So, the total number of different arrangements would be the product of the number of ways you can choose the parents for the head and tail, multiplied by the number of ways you can arrange the children in the remaining spots:

4 (ways to choose parent for head) * 3 (ways to choose parent for tail) * 3 (ways to arrange the children) = 36

Therefore, ####36#### different arrangements are possible.

Let \(a, b > 0\) and \(a + \frac{1}{b} = 2\). What is the minimum value of \(b + \frac{1}{a}\)?  

模型回答: Given \(a + \frac{1}{b} = 2\), we want to find the minimum value of \(b + \frac{1}{a}\).

To simplify the expression, we start by rearranging the equation:
\(a = 2 - \frac{1}{b}\).

We can substitute this \(a\) back into the expression that we want to minimize:
\(b + \frac{1}{a} = b + \frac{1}{2 - \frac{1}{b}}\).

To find the minimum value, we can consider the function \(f(b) = b + \frac{1}{2 - \frac{1}{b}}\), where \(b > 0\).

Next, we find the derivative of the function:
\(f'(b) = 1 + \frac{1}{\left(2 - \frac{1}{b}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{b^2}\).

To find the minimum, we set the derivative equal to zero:
\(1 + \frac{1}{\left(2 - \frac{1}{b}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{b^2} = 0\).

Solving this equation will give us the value of \(b\) that minimizes the function \(f(b),\) from which we can then find the minimum value of \(b + \frac{1}{a}####.\)

第22题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Line \( l_1: x - y + 6 = 0 \) intersects the x-axis at point \( A \) and the y-axis at point \( B \). It also intersects the circle \( (x + 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = r^2 \) (\( r > 0 \)) at points \( C \) and \( D \). Given \( |AB| = 3|CD| \), what is the value of \( r \)?

模型回答: Step 1: Find the x and y intercepts of line \( l_1 \):
By setting \( y = 0 \) in the equation of \( l_1 \), we get the x-intercept:
\( x - 0 + 6 = 0 \)
\( x = -6 \)
So, the x-intercept is \( A(-6, 0) \).

By setting \( x = 0 \) in the equation of \( l_1 \), we get the y-intercept:
\( 0 - y + 6 = 0 \)
\( y = 6 \)
So, the y-intercept is \( B(0, 6) \).

Step 2: Find the center and radius of the circle:
Comparing the equation of the circle with standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), we have \( h = -1 \) and \( k = 3 \). So, the center of the circle is \( (-1, 3) \).

The radius of the circle is \( r \).

Step 3: Find the intersection points of the line \( l_1 \) and the circle:
Substitute the equation of line \( l_1 \) into the equation of the circle:
\( (-6 + 1)^2 + (0 - 3)^2 = r^2 \)
\( 25 = r^2 \)
\( r = 5 \)

The distance between the x and y-intercepts, \( |AB| = \sqrt{(-6 - 0)^2 + (0 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} \).

The distance between points \( C \) and \( D \) on the circle is twice the radius, thus:
\( |CD| = 2r = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

Given that \( |AB| = 3|CD| \), we have:
\( \sqrt{72} = 3 \times 10 \)
\( \sqrt{72} = 30 \)

Let the hyperbola \( C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) (\( a > 0 \), \( b > 0 \)) have left and right foci \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) respectively. Draw a straight line parallel to the \( y \)-axis through \( F_2 \), which intersects \( C \) at points \( A \) and \( B \). If \( |F_1A| = 14 \) and \( |AB| = 8 \), what is the eccentricity \( e \) of \( C \)?

模型回答: To find the eccentricity \( e \) of the hyperbola, we need to first identify the relationship between the points involved and the eccentricity of the hyperbola.

Let's break down the information given:
- Hyperbola equation: \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \)
- Left focus: \( F_1 \)
- Right focus: \( F_2 \)
- Points on hyperbola intersected by the line through \( F_2 \): \( A \) and \( B \)
- Given distances: \( |F_1A| = 14 \), \( |AB| = 8 \)

In a hyperbola, the eccentricity is related to the foci distances and the distance from a point on the hyperbola to the foci. Specifically, the eccentricity \( e \) is defined as \( e = \frac{c}{a} \), where \( c \) is the distance from the center of the hyperbola to either focus, and \( a \) is the distance from the center of the hyperbola to a vertex.

We need to use the given information to determine the value of \( e \).

First, note that the midpoint of segment \( AB \) lies at the center of the hyperbola.

Let's set up an equation involving the given distances:
Distance from center to right focus \( c = |F_2B| = \frac{AB}{2} = 4 \)
The distance from the center to the right vertex is \( a = c + |F_2A| = 14 + 4 = 18 \)

Now, we have all the necessary values to calculate the eccentricity:
\( e = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9} \)

Therefore, ####e = 2/9####.

There are 4 identical balls, each marked with the number 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. We randomly draw 3 times with replacement, taking 1 ball each time. Let \( X \) be the number of balls that are drawn at least once among these 5 balls. What is the mathematical expectation \( E(X) \) of \( X \)?

模型回答: To find the mathematical expectation \( E(X) \) of \( X \) in this scenario, we can calculate the probabilities of drawing each unique ball at least once in the 3 draws and sum them up.

Let's consider the probabilities of drawing each unique ball at least once in the 3 draws:
- The probability of drawing ball 1 at least once: \( P(\text{ball 1 is drawn at least once}) = 1 - P(\text{ball 1 is not drawn at all}) \)
  - The probability of not drawing ball 1 in a single draw is \( \frac{3}{4} \), as there are 4 balls in total and 3 of them are not ball 1.
  - Therefore, the probability of not drawing ball 1 in any of the 3 draws is \( (\frac{3}{4})^3 \).
  - So, the probability of drawing ball 1 at least once is \( 1 - (\frac{3}{4})^3 \).

Similarly, we can calculate the probabilities of drawing each of the other three balls (2, 3, and 4) at least once in the 3 draws.

Finally, we sum up these probabilities to get the expected value:
\( E(X) = P(\text{ball 1 is drawn at least once}) + P(\text{ball 2 is drawn at least once}) + P(\text{ball 3 is drawn at least once}) + P(\text{ball 4 is drawn at least once}) \).

Now, let's calculate the probabilities and find the sum for the expected value.

Probability of drawing ball 1 at least once: \( 1 - (\frac{3}{4})^3 \)  
Probability of drawing ball 2 at least once: \( 1 - (\frac{3}{4})^3 \)  
Probability of drawing ball 3 at least once: \( 1 - (\frac{3}{4})^3 \)  
Probability of drawing ball 4 at least once: \( 1 - (\frac{3}{4})^3 \)

Adding these probabilities together gives us the expected value \( E(X) \):

Given the universal set \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \), set \( A = \{1, 3\} \), and set \( B = \{2, 5\} \), what is \( \complement_U (A \cup B) \)?

模型回答: Let's break down the given information and the steps:

1. Set \( A \) consists of elements 1 and 3, so \( A = \{1, 3\} \).
2. Set \( B \) consists of elements 2 and 5, so \( B = \{2, 5\} \).
3. The union of sets \( A \) and \( B \) is \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 5\} \).
4. The complement of a set in the universal set \( U \) is the set of elements in \( U \) that are not in the original set. So, \( \complement_U (A \cup B) \) would be the elements in \( U \) that are not in the set \( A \cup B \).

Now, we determine the complement by subtracting the elements in \( A \cup B \) from the universal set \( U \):

\( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)

Elements in \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 5\} \)

Complement of \( A \cup B \):

\( U - (A \cup B) = \{4\} \)

Therefore, \( \complement_U (A \cup B) = \{4\} \).

In triangle  ABC, D is the midpoint of side AB. \(\overrightarrow{CE} = \frac{2}{3}\overrightarrow{CD}\), \(\overrightarrow{AB} = \vec{a}\), \(\overrightarrow{AC} = \vec{b}\). Given \(|\overrightarrow{AE}| = 5\) and \(AE \perp CB\), what is \(\overrightarrow{AE} \cdot \overrightarrow{CD}\)? 

模型回答: Given that D is the midpoint of side AB, we have \(\overrightarrow{AD} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{AB}\).

Since \(\overrightarrow{CE} = \frac{2}{3}\overrightarrow{CD}\), we can rewrite it as \(\overrightarrow{CE} = \frac{2}{3}(\overrightarrow{CD} - \overrightarrow{CH})\), where H is the point on line CD such that DH is parallel and equal in length to CE. 

Also, since \(AE \perp CB\), \(\overrightarrow{AE} \cdot \overrightarrow{CB} = 0\). Expanding this, we get \(\overrightarrow{AE} \cdot \overrightarrow{CE} + \overrightarrow{AE} \cdot \overrightarrow{EB} = 0\).

Now, we have \(AE = AD + DE = \frac{1}{2}AB + DE\), and since \(\overrightarrow{AB} = \vec{a}\), \(\overrightarrow{DE} = \vec{a} + \vec{b}\) since D and E are on the same line.

Substitute these expressions back into the equation from the perpendicularity condition, solve for \(\overrightarrow{AE}\), and express it in terms of \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\). 

After finding the expression for \(\overrightarrow{AE}\), calculate \(\overrightarrow{AE} \cdot \overrightarrow{CD}\) which simplifies to a numeric solution.

Given that the domain of the function \( f(x) \) is \( (-1, +\infty) \), \( f(0) = 0 \), and its derivative \( f'(x-1) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \). Let \( l_1 \) be the tangent line to the curve \( y = f(x) \) at point \( A(a, f(a)) \) (\( a \neq 0 \)). Find the maximum value of \( f'(x) \).

模型回答: To find the maximum value of \( f'(x) \), we need to analyze the derivative function \( f'(x) \) given as \( f'(x-1) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \).

First, we need to find an expression for \( f'(x) \). Using the chain rule, we have:
\[ f'(x) = f'(x-1) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x-1) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \cdot 1 = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \]

To find the maximum value of \( f'(x) \), we can set its derivative equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \right) = 0 \]
\[ \frac{1 - \ln(x)}{x^2} = 0 \]

Solving this gives us \( x = e \), which corresponds to the maximum value of \( f'(x) \).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f'(x) \) is at \( x = e \), and the maximum value is \( \frac{\ln(e)}{e} = \frac{1}{e} \).

####So, the maximum value of \( f'(x) \) is ####1/e####.

If the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) is a tangent line to the curve \( y = e^x + x + 2a \), what is the value of \( a \)?

模型回答: To find the value of \( a \), we need to determine where the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) intersects the curve \( y = e^x + x + 2a \) so that it is a tangent line.

First, let's find the point of intersection between the line and the curve by setting the two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2x + 5 = e^x + x + 2a \]

Next, we need to find the derivative of the curve equation \( y = e^x + x + 2a \) to get the gradient of the curve. The derivative is:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = e^x + 1 \]

Since the line and the curve are tangent at the point of intersection, the gradients of the line and the curve at that point are equal. The gradient of the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) is simply the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

Setting the gradients equal gives:
\[ 2 = e^x + 1 \]

Now, solve the above equation for \( x \) to find the x-coordinate of the point of tangency.

After finding the x-coordinate, substitute it back into either the line equation or the curve equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate.

Finally, use the point of tangency (x, y) to solve for \( a \) in the equation \( y = e^x + x + 2a \).

A closed cylindrical container (ignoring the thickness of the container wall) has a base radius of 4 cm and a height of 9 cm. There are two iron balls of equal radius inside the container. What is the maximum diameter (in centimeters) of the iron balls?

模型回答: 1. The volume of the closed cylindrical container is given by the formula: V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the container.
2. Substituting the values given, the volume of the container is V = π(4^2)(9) = 144π cm^3.
3. Since there are two identical iron balls inside the container, the total volume occupied by the balls is half of the volume of the container: 144π / 2 = 72π cm^3.
4. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
5. Substitute the volume of the iron balls into the formula and solve for the radius: 72π = (4/3)πr^3. Simplify to find r^3 = 54. Therefore, r ≈ 3.78 cm.
6. The maximum diameter of the iron balls is twice the radius: Diameter = 2 * 3.78 ≈ 7.56 cm.

If \( x = 2 \) is an extreme point of the function \( f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - a) \), what is the value of \( f(4) \)?

模型回答: 1. Since \( x = 2 \) is an extreme point of the function \( f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - a) \), it implies that the derivative of the function at that point is equal to zero.

2. We first find the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \):
\[ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - a)] \]
Expanding this using the product rule, we get
\[ f'(x) = (x-2)(x-a) + (x-1)(x-a) + (x-1)(x-2) \]

3. Next, substituting \( x = 2 \) into the derivative and setting it equal to zero:
\[ f'(2) = (2-2)(2-a) + (2-1)(2-a) + (2-1)(2-2) = 0 \]

4. By solving the equation, you can find the value of \( a \).

5. Once you have the value of \( a \), you can find \( f(4) \) by substituting \( x = 4 \) into the original function \( f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - a) \). Calculate this value to find the final answer.
