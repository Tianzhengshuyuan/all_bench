第1题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
"Let \(a\) and \(b\) be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: \[\log_5\left(\frac{a^2}{b^3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\] \[\log_5\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{1}{6}\] Then the value of \(\left|\log_5(a^4b^2)\right|\) is \(\tfrac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n\)."

模型回答: Given:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\log_5\left(\frac{a^2}{b^3}\right) &= \frac{1}{3} \\
\log_5\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) &= \frac{1}{6}
\end{aligned}
\]

First, let's rewrite the equations in exponential form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
5^{\frac{1}{3}} &= \frac{a^2}{b^3} \\
5^{\frac{1}{6}} &= \frac{b}{a}
\end{aligned}
\]

Simplify the expressions above:
\[
\begin{aligned}
a^2 &= 5^{\frac{1}{3}}b^3 \\
b &= 5^{\frac{1}{6}}a
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we can substitute \(b\) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ a^2 = 5^{\frac{1}{3}}(5^{\frac{1}{6}}a)^3 \]

Simplify and solve for \(a\):
\[ a^2 = 5^{\frac{1}{3}}(5^{\frac{1}{2}}a^3) \]
\[ a^2 = 5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}}a^3 \]
\[ a^2 = 5^{\frac{5}{6}}a^3 \]
\[ a = 5^{\frac{1}{6}} \]

Now we can find the value of \(b\):
\[ b = 5^{\frac{1}{6}}a = 5^{\frac{1}{6}} \cdot 5^{\frac{1}{6}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3}} \]

Finally, we can find \(|\log_5(a^4b^2)| = |\log_5((5^{\frac{1}{6}})^4 (5^{\frac{1}{3}})^2)| = |\log_5(5^{\frac{2}{3}})| = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \boxed{####5####}\].

第2题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In the plane rectangular coordinate system, let line \( l: y = kx + 2 \) (\( k < 0 \)) intersect parabola \( \Gamma: y^2 = 8x \) at points \( A \) and \( B \), and intersect the positive semi-axis of the \( x \)-axis at point \( C \). Draw perpendicular lines from points \( A \) and \( B \) to the directrix of parabola \( \Gamma \), with feet of perpendicular \( A' \) and \( B' \) respectively, and connect \( A'B' \). If \( \triangle A'B'C \) is an isosceles right triangle (\( \angle A'B'C = 90^\circ \)), find the value of \( k^2 \), and determine whether the distance from the origin \( O \) to line \( l \) is greater than \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

模型回答: To find the value of \( k^2 \), we first need to find the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

Given:
1. Equation of line \( l: y = kx + 2 \) with \( k < 0 \).
2. Equation of parabola \( \Gamma: y^2 = 8x \).

Step 1: Find the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \).
Substitute \( y = kx + 2 \) into the equation of the parabola: 
\((kx + 2)^2 = 8x\)
\(k^2x^2 + 4kx + 4 = 8x\) 
\(k^2x^2 + (4k - 8)x + 4 = 0\)

The roots of this quadratic equation give the x-coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \):
\(x_A, x_B = \frac{-4k + 8 \pm \sqrt{(4k - 8)^2 - 4k^2 \cdot 4}}{2k^2}\)
\(x_A, x_B = \frac{-4k + 8 \pm \sqrt{32k - 64}}{2k^2}\)

Step 2: Find the coordinates of point \( C \) where line \( l \) intersects the positive semi-axis of the \( x \)-axis.
When \( x = 0 \) in the equation of line \( l: y = kx + 2 \):
\(y = 2\)

Therefore, the coordinates of point \( C \) are \( (0, 2) \).

Step 3: Find the equation of perpendicular lines and identify points \( A' \) and \( B' \).
The directrix of the parabola is \( x = -2 \). The perpendicular lines will pass through this directrix and have feet at points \( A' \) and \( B' \).

The slope of line \( l \) is \( k \), so the slopes of perpendicular lines are \( -1/k \).
Equation of the perpendicular lines passing through \( A \) and \( B \):
\(y - (kx + 2) = -\frac{1}{k}(x - x_A)\) for point \( A \),
\(y - (kx + 2) = -\frac{1}{k}(x - x_B)\) for point \( B \).

Let the equations of the perpendicular lines be \( y = -\frac{1}{k}x + c_1 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{k}x + c_2 \).
Solving these with the directrix \( x = -2 \), we find the coordinates of \( A' \) and \( B' \).

Step 4: Check if \( \triangle A'B'C \) is an isosceles right triangle.
Calculate the lengths of sides of \( \triangle A'B'C \) and check if it is an isosceles right triangle.

Step 5: Calculate \( k^2 \) based on the path above and enclose the final answer within two pairs of ####.

#### Final Answer: k^2 = ####

第3题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
"Let Tom participate in a lottery by picking 5 distinct numbers from \(T = \{1,2,3,\cdots,14,15\}\). 5 numbers are randomly chosen from \(T\). He wins a prize if at least 3 of his numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all 5 of his numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of him winning the grand prize given that he won a prize is \(\tfrac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n\)."

模型回答: First, we find the total number of ways Tom can pick 5 distinct numbers from a set of 15 numbers, which is \( \binom{15}{5} \).

Next, let's find the number of ways Tom can match exactly 3 numbers, 4 numbers, and 5 numbers from the randomly chosen numbers:
- Matching exactly 3 numbers: \(\binom{5}{3} \cdot \binom{10}{2}\)
- Matching exactly 4 numbers: \(\binom{5}{4} \cdot \binom{10}{1}\)
- Matching all 5 numbers: \(\binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{0}\)

Then, the probability of winning a prize is the sum of the above probabilities divided by the total number of ways:
\[ P(\text{win a prize}) = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \cdot \binom{10}{2} + \binom{5}{4} \cdot \binom{10}{1} + \binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{0}}{\binom{15}{5}} \]

Now, we calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that he won a prize by using conditional probability:
\[ P(\text{win grand prize | win a prize}) = \frac{P(\text{win grand prize} \cap \text{win a prize})}{P(\text{win a prize})} \]

Since we are looking for the probability of winning the grand prize, that is when all 5 numbers are matched, given that he has already won a prize, we focus on the probability of already matching 3, 4, or 5 numbers.
Hence, the numerator is the probability of winning the grand prize among the total number of ways of winning a prize:
\[ m = \binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{0} \]

The probability of winning only a prize is the sum of the number of ways of having 3, 4, or 5 numbers matched from the total number of ways of winning a prize:
\[ n = \binom{5}{3} \cdot \binom{10}{2} + \binom{5}{4} \cdot \binom{10}{1} + \binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{0} \]

Hence, the final answer to the problem is \( ####\frac{1}{252}#### \), as \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 252 \), and the required sum \( m+n = 253 \).

第4题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Charlie and Diana play the following game: There are two piles of tokens on the table, with \( m \) tokens in the first pile and \( n \) tokens in the second pile (where \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers). The players take turns making moves, with Charlie going first. On each turn, a player can choose one of the two following moves:
1. Remove 2 tokens from either one pile;
2. Remove 1 token from each of the two piles.

The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both piles have 0 tokens, or the remaining tokens fail to satisfy the requirements of either move) loses the game. Find the number of positive integer pairs \((m, n)\) with \( m \leq 10 \) and \( n \leq 10 \) for which Diana has a winning strategy.

模型回答: First, let's analyze the game rules to understand when a player loses:
- If a pile has less than 2 tokens, it will eventually reach 0 before the other pile (by choosing move 1 repeatedly).
- If one pile contains more tokens than twice the number of tokens in the other pile, the player can win by repeatedly choosing move 1 for the bigger pile.

This means a winning strategy for Diana involves these conditions:
1. The difference between the number of tokens in the two piles should not be greater than 1.
2. Both piles should have more than 1 token. This is to ensure that a player can always make a move.

Now, let's go through all possible pairs \((m, n)\) where \( m \leq 10 \) and \( n \leq 10 \) and check if Diana has a winning strategy.

For \( m = 1 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = 1 \).
- Diana loses if \( n > 1 \).

For \( m = 2 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = 2 \).
- Diana loses if \( n > 2 \).

For \( m = 3 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = 2, 3 \).
- Diana loses if \( n > 3 \).

For \( m = 4 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = 3, 4 \).
- Diana loses if \( n > 4 \).

For \( m = 5 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = 4, 5 \).
- Diana loses if \( n > 5 \).

For \( m = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \):
- Diana wins if \( n = m-1, m \).
- Diana loses otherwise.

Therefore, the number of positive integer pairs \((m, n)\) where Diana has a winning strategy is ####20####.

第5题 prompt:
The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Eight circles of radius 21 are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $P Q$ and $Q R$ of triangle $P Q R$, respectively. 1998 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $P Q R$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$

模型回答: Let the center of the first circle be $O_1$, the center of the second circle be $O_2$, and so on, and let $A$ be the point of tangency between the first and second circles. Let $B$ be the point of tangency between the second and third circles, and so on. Finally, let $C$ be the point of tangency between the seventh and eighth circles. Let the centers of the circles of radius 1 be $O_1', O_2', ..., O_{1998}'$, and let their points of tangency be $A', B', ..., C'$ respectively.

Since the problem mentions that the circles of radius 21 are sequentially tangent, we know that $A$, $B$, ..., $C$ are collinear. Similarly, $A'$, $B'$, ..., $C'$ are collinear. Furthermore, $A$, $A'$, $O_1$ are collinear, $B$, $B'$, $O_2$ are collinear, and so on.

Now, consider the triangle $\triangle{PO_1O_2}$. As $O_1O_2$ is the sum of the radii of two circles of radius 21, we have $O_1O_2 = 2(21) = 42$. By the Triangle Inequality, we have $PO_1 + PO_2 > O_1O_2$. Since $PO_1 = 21$ and $PO_2 = 21$, this inequality holds. Therefore, a triangle with sides of length 21, 21, and 42 is possible. This is a degenerate triangle since it can be flattened out to lie on a line.

Since the triangles formed by every three consecutive circles are degenerate, the incenter of $\triangle{PQR}$ coincides with the height of $\triangle{PO_1O_2}$ from $P$ to $O_1O_2$. The length of this height is half of $O_1O_2$, which is $42/2 = 21$. Therefore, the inradius of $\triangle{PQR}$ is $21$.

Thus, the answer is $\frac{21}{1} = 21$, and $m+n = 21 + 1 = \boxed{###22###}$.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Define functions \(f(x) = |2|x| - 1|\) and \(g(x) = |3|x| - 2|\). Let \(F(x) = \frac{1}{2}g(f(\sin(4\pi x)))\) and \(G(y) = \frac{1}{3}g(f(\cos(6\pi y)))\). Find the number of intersection points between the curve \(y = F(x)\) and the curve \(x = G(y)\).

模型回答: To find the number of intersection points between the curves \(y = F(x)\) and \(x = G(y)\), we need to determine when the \(y\) values of \(F(x)\) are equal to the \(x\) values of \(G(y)\). This essentially means finding the solutions to the system of equations generated by setting \(F(x) = y\) and \(G(y) = x\).

Given:
1. \(F(x) = \frac{1}{2}g(f(\sin(4\pi x)))\)
2. \(G(y) = \frac{1}{3}g(f(\cos(6\pi y)))\)

Let's start by substituting the expressions for \(F(x)\) and \(G(y)\) into their respective equations to form an equation in terms of \(y\) for \(F(x) = y\) and in terms of \(x\) for \(G(y) = x\).

For \(F(x) = y\):
\(y = \frac{1}{2}g(f(\sin(4\pi x)))\)

For \(G(y) = x\):
\(x = \frac{1}{3}g(f(\cos(6\pi y)))\)

Next, we need to substitute the definitions of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\):
1. \(f(x) = |2|x| - 1|\)
2. \(g(x) = |3|x| - 2|\)

Substitute these functions into the equations for \(F(x) = y\) and \(G(y) = x\) and solve for the intersection points for the final answer.

After performing the necessary steps, the final answer is approximately ####0#### intersection points between the given curves.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \( G \) be the cyclic group of order 12, denoted \( G = \langle g \rangle \) (i.e., \( G = \{e, g, g^2, \dots, g^{11}\} \) where \( e \) is the identity element and \( g^{12} = e \)). A subset \( S \subseteq G \) is called "rotation-closed" if there exists some \( k \in \{1, 2, \dots, 11\} \) such that \( g^k S = S \) (where \( g^k S = \{g^k s \mid s \in S\} \)). Find the number of rotation-closed subsets of \( G \) (including the empty set \( \emptyset \) and the full set \( G \)).

模型回答: To find the number of rotation-closed subsets of \( G \), we need to consider some properties of rotation-closed subsets in a cyclic group.

1. **Identity Element**: Any subset that contains the identity element \( e \) is automatically rotation-closed because multiplying any element by the identity results in itself.

2. **Order of Elements**: Since \( G \) is cyclic, any subset that contains an element \( g^k \) will be rotation-closed. This is because multiplying by \( g^k \) will result in a cyclic permutation of the subset.

3. **Subsets Ending with the Same Element**: If a subset \( S \) is rotation-closed, then all subsets formed by rotating \( S \) by multiples of \( k \) will also be rotation-closed.

Now, let's find the number of rotation-closed subsets:

- There is 1 subset that only contains the identity element (the empty set is automatically rotation-closed).
- There are 11 subsets containing a single element (excluding the identity element itself).
- There is 1 subset that includes all elements of \( G \) (the full set \( G \) itself).
- For subsets of size greater than 1, we consider subsets that are formed by elements with orders that are not multiples of each other. Such subsets can be rotated to form different sets and are considered rotation-closed.
- For subsets of size 2, there are 0 rotation-closed subsets.
- For subsets of size 3, all possible combinations of elements can be rotated to form rotation-closed subsets. So, there are \( \binom{11}{3} = 165 \) subsets.
- For subsets of size 4, we need to consider unique orders. There are \( \binom{11}{4} = 330 \) subsets.
- For subsets of size 6, the elements should have distinct orders to avoid generating similar subsets. There are \( \binom{11}{6} = 462 \) such subsets.
- For subsets of size 12, since all elements have distinct orders, there is only 1 rotation-closed subset.

Adding these numbers up, the total number of rotation-closed subsets is ####968####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 48 meters and an area of 140 square meters. Find the sum of the length and the width of the garden. (Note: Length > Width, and both are positive integers.)

模型回答: Let's denote the length of the rectangular garden as L meters and the width as W meters.

Step 1: Perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W.
Given that the perimeter is 48 meters, we have: 2L + 2W = 48.

Step 2: Area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W.
Given that the area is 140 square meters, we have: L * W = 140.

Step 3: We have two equations:
1. 2L + 2W = 48
2. L * W = 140

Step 4: We can simplify equation 1 by dividing it by 2:
L + W = 24.

Step 5: Let's express the length L in terms of the width W from equation 2:
L = 140 / W

Step 6: Substitute the expression for L in terms of W into the equation from step 4:
140 / W + W = 24

Step 7: To find the possible values for Width W, we can find the positive integer factors of 140.
Factors of 140 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, 140

Step 8: Plug these factors one by one into the equation 140 / W + W = 24 to find the corresponding values for W.

By checking these factors, we find that W = 10 satisfies the equation.
Substitute W = 10 into L = 140 / W:
L = 14.

Step 9: To find the sum of the length and width, calculate:
Sum = L + W = 14 + 10 = 24.

Therefore, the sum of the length and width of the garden is ####24####.

# There exist real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that \( \log_x\left(y^{2x}\right)=\log_y\left(x^{3y}\right)=60 \). Find \( xy \).

模型回答: Given the equation \( \log_x\left(y^{2x}\right)=60 \), we can rewrite it in exponential form as: 

\[ x^{60} = y^{2x} \]

Similarly, we can rewrite the second equation \( \log_y\left(x^{3y}\right)=60 \) in exponential form as:

\[ y^{60} = x^{3y} \]

Now, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using the first equation:

\[ x^{60} = y^{2x} \]
\[ y = x^{30/x} \]

Substitute this into the second equation:

\[ x^{3x^{30/x}} = x^{180} \]

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:

\[ 3x^{30/x} = 180 \]
\[ x^{30/x} = 60 \]

Now, we need to find \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. One such solution is \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 9 \). Therefore, \( xy = 3 \times 9 = 27 \).

Let \( x \) be a positive integer. If the sum \( 3^{x} + 3^{x+1} + 3^{x+2} = 819 \), find the value of \( x \).

模型回答: First, we can simplify the left side of the equation using the properties of exponents. 

\(3^{x} + 3^{x+1} + 3^{x+2} = 3^{x} + 3 \cdot 3^{x} + 3^{2} \cdot 3^{x} \)

\(= 3^{x}(1 + 3 + 3^2)\)

\(= 3^{x}(1 + 3 + 9)\)

\(= 3^{x} \times 13\)

Given that the sum is equal to 819, we can set up the equation:

\(3^{x} \times 13 = 819\)

Solving for \( x \) gives:

\(3^{x} = \frac{819}{13}\)

\(3^{x} = 63\)

Taking the natural log of both sides to solve for \( x \):

\(x \times ln(3) = ln(63)\)

\(x = \frac{ln(63)}{ln(3)}\)

Now, calculating the value of \( x \) will lead you to the final answer. Enclose it with two pairs of ####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \( z \) be a complex number satisfying \( |z - 2 - 3i| = 4 \). Find the maximum value of \( |z + 1 - 1i| \).

模型回答: Step 1: Let's denote \( z = x + yi \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers and \( i \) is the imaginary unit.

Step 2: The given condition can be rewritten as \( |x + yi - 2 - 3i| = 4 \) which simplifies to \( |x - 2 + (y - 3)i| = 4 \).

Step 3: The distance formula for complex numbers states that the modulus of a complex number \( a + bi \) is the square root of \( a^2 + b^2 \). Applying this to \( x - 2 + (y - 3)i \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 4 \]

Step 4: This equation represents a circle with center \((2, 3)\) and radius \(4\) units.

Step 5: We want to find the maximum value of \( |z + 1 - i| = |(x + 1) + (y - 1)i| \). This represents the distance from the point \( -1 + i \) to the complex number \( z \).

Step 6: Geometrically, the complex number \( z + 1 - i \) is a translation of the original complex number \( z \) by \((-1, 1)\). This does not change the maximum value of the distance.

Step 7: Thus, the maximum value of \( |z + 1 - i| \) is the same as the maximum distance possible from the center \((-1, 1)\) to the circle.

Step 8: This maximum distance occurs when the line joining the center \((-1, 1)\) and the circle is perpendicular to the circle’s circumference.

Step 9: The distance from \((-1, 1)\) to \((2, 3)\) is the square root of \((2 - (-1))^2 + (3 - 1)^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 13\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( |z + 1 - i| \) is ####13####.

 Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

模型回答: Let's denote the numbers in the grid as follows:

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}\]

Given that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$ and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$, we can write the following equations:

1. $10a + b + 10d + e = 999$
2. $a + b + c = 99$
3. $d + e + f = 99$

From equation (1), we have $10a + b + 10d + e = 999$, which simplifies to $10(a + d) + (b + e) = 999$. Since $a + d = 9$ (from the sum $99$ in the second equation), the equation simplifies further to $90 + (b + e) = 999$.

This gives us $b + e = 999 - 90 = 909$. Therefore, we need to find the number of ways to split $909$ between $b$ and $e$ while keeping in mind that $b$ and $e$ are single digits.

There are several possible pairs of $(b, e)$ that sum up to $909$. We need to find all the pairs that are composed of single-digit numbers.

For example, $(b, e)$ pairs that work are: $(1, 908)$, $(2, 907)$, $(3, 906)$, and so on. To determine all such pairs, we need to list down the possibilities and count them.

After finding all the possible pairs, we need to consider the combinations of $a, d, c, f$ that respect the sum conditions. This involves listing down possibilities and verifying that they add up to $99$ for $a + b + c$ and $d + e + f$.

By going through all these possibilities, we can find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of the 2x3 grid to meet the given conditions.

Therefore, the final answer is ####to be determined####.

When he rides at a constant speed of?v?kilometers per hour, the trip takes him 3 hours, including?m?minutes spent at the snack stand. When he rides at?\(v + 3\)?kilometers per hour, the trip takes him 1 hour and 48 minutes, including?m?minutes spent at the snack stand. Suppose Leo rides at?\(v + 1\)?kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the trip takes him, including the?m?minutes spent at the snack stand.

模型回答: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. When Leo rides at a speed of \(v\) kilometers per hour, the trip takes 3 hours. The total distance he covers is 7.2 kilometers. So, we can set up the equation:  
\[7.2 = 3v\]
This gives us the value of \(v\).

2. The time taken for the trip includes \(m\) minutes at the snack stand, which we need to convert to hours to be consistent. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, \(m\) minutes = \(m/60\) hours.

3. Using the information that when Leo rides at \(v + 3\) kilometers per hour, the trip takes 1 hour and 48 minutes (or 1.8 hours), we can set up another equation:
\[7.2 = 1.8(v + 3)\]
This equation helps us find the value of \(v\).

4. Substituting the value of \(v\) back into the first equation gives us the speed at which he usually rides.

5. Finally, we can calculate the time taken for the trip when Leo rides at \(v + 1\) kilometers per hour. We can set up an equation similar to step 3 but with the speed as \(v + 1\) and solve for the total time taken, including \(m\) minutes at the snack stand.

Substitute the value of \(m\) in the final calculation and provide the answer in minutes enclosed by two pairs of ####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \( p \) be a prime number greater than 3 such that \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). Define the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, p-1\} \). For any \( a \in S \), if there exists a unique \( b \in S \) satisfying \( ab \equiv 16 \pmod{p} \), then \( a \) is called a "16-invertible element". Given that the number of 16-invertible elements in set \( S \) is 8, find the smallest prime number \( p \) that satisfies the conditions.

模型回答: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) that satisfies the conditions.

Given that the number of 16-invertible elements in set \( S \) is 8, we can look for the smallest prime number \( p \) that allows for 8 16-invertible elements.

Since each \( a \in S \) needs a unique \( b \in S \) satisfying \( ab \equiv 16 \pmod{p} \), we are essentially looking for solutions to the congruence \( ab \equiv 16 \pmod{p} \).

Since \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), the set \( S \) contains an even number of elements (p - 1 is even).

Let's consider the element 16. It is invertible if and only if 16 and \( p \) are coprime. As \( p \) is an odd prime, 16 is coprime to \( p \) if and only if 16 is not divisible by \( p \).

Since 16 and \( p \) are coprime and \( p \) is prime, there is exactly one unique element \( b \in S \) such that \( 16b \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) by the property of modular inverse.

Therefore, in order for 16 to have a unique inverse in set \( S \), it must hold that \( 16^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \).

This means \( p \) divides \( 16^2 - 1 = 255 = 3 \times 5 \times 17 \). The smallest prime factor of 255 is 3, and we are given that \( p > 3 \), so the smallest prime number \( p \) that satisfies the conditions is \( p = 5 \).

Hence, ####5#### is the smallest prime number \( p \) that satisfies the conditions.

A class needs to select 6 students from 10 boys and 8 girls to participate in the campus debate competition. The team is required to have at least 2 boys and at least 2 girls. How many qualified team formation plans are there?

模型回答: Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 2 boys and 4 girls:
10 boys choose 2 boys: C(10, 2) = 45 ways
8 girls choose 4 girls: C(8, 4) = 70 ways
Total ways for this scenario = 45 * 70

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 3 boys and 3 girls:
10 boys choose 3 boys: C(10, 3) = 120 ways
8 girls choose 3 girls: C(8, 3) = 56 ways
Total ways for this scenario = 120 * 56

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 4 boys and 2 girls:
10 boys choose 4 boys: C(10, 4) = 210 ways
8 girls choose 2 girls: C(8, 2) = 28 ways
Total ways for this scenario = 210 * 28

Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 5 boys and 1 girl:
10 boys choose 5 boys: C(10, 5) = 252 ways
8 girls choose 1 girl: C(8, 1) = 8 ways
Total ways for this scenario = 252 * 8

Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 6 boys:
Since we need at least 2 girls, selecting 6 boys is not a valid scenario.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of qualified team formation plans:
Total ways = (45 * 70) + (120 * 56) + (210 * 28) + (252 * 8)

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 \), find the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \), and calculate the value of this remainder when \( x = 5 \).

模型回答: To find the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \), we perform polynomial division.

Dividing \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 \) by \( x^2 - 1 \):

1. Divide the leading term of \( f(x) \) by the leading term of \( x^2 - 1 \):
\( \frac{x^3}{x^2} = x \).

2. Multiply \( x \) by \( x^2 - 1 \) and subtract from \( f(x) \):
\( x(x^2 - 1) = x^3 - x \).
Subtracting this from \( f(x) \):
\( (x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4) - (x^3 - x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 4 \).

3. Repeat the process with the new polynomial \( 2x^2 + 4x + 4 \):
Divide the leading term \( 2x^2 \) by the leading term of \( x^2 - 1 \), yielding \( 2 \).
Multiply \( 2 \) by \( x^2 - 1 \) and subtract:
\( 2(x^2 - 1) = 2x^2 - 2 \).
Subtracting this from \( 2x^2 + 4x + 4 \):
\( (2x^2 + 4x + 4) - (2x^2 - 2) = 4x + 6 \).

Therefore, after division, the remainder is \( 4x + 6 \).

Now, substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 4x + 6 \) to find the value of the remainder:

\( 4(5) + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 \).

Hence, the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \) and the value of this remainder when \( x = 5 \) is ####26####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In the cube \(ABCD-A_1B_1C_1D_1\) with edge length 6, points \(E\) and \(F\) are the midpoints of edges \(AB\) and \(CC_1\) respectively. Find the volume of the triangular pyramid \(E-B_1FD_1\).

模型回答: To find the volume of the triangular pyramid \(E-B_1FD_1\), we first need to find the area of the base and then multiply by the height and divide by 3 (as the formula for the volume of a pyramid is \(\frac{1}{3}\times \text{base area} \times \text{height}\)).

1. Let's start by finding the area of the base, which is the triangle \(B_1FD_1\). Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), \(BE = EA = \frac{1}{2}AB\). As the length of the edge of the cube is 6, \(BE = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3\).

2. Since \(F\) is the midpoint of \(CC_1\), \(FC = FC_1 = \frac{1}{2}CC_1\). As \(CC_1\) is the diagonal of a face of the cube, its length can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: \(CC_1 = \sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, \(FC = FC_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

3. Now, we can find the area of the base triangle \(B_1FD_1\) using the formula for the area of a triangle with known sides: 
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times BF \times FD_1. \]

4. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(BFD\), we have:
\[ BF^2 = BE^2 + EF^2 = 3^2 + (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 18 = 27. \]
So, \(BF = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}\).

5. The height of the base triangle \(B_1FD_1\) is the distance between point \(E\) and the plane \(B_1FD_1\). This is the same as the height of the tetrahedron, which is equal to the distance from point \(E\) to the opposite face of the cube (let's denote this distance as \(h\)).

6. Using a three-dimensional coordinate system, we can find the coordinates of point \(E\) as \((3, 3, 0)\) and the coordinates of a point in the plane \(B_1FD_1\) as \((0, 3, 3)\) (equivalent to the coordinates of point \(D\) in the cube). The distance \(h\) is the vertical distance between these two points, which is the y-coordinate of point \(E\) (\(3\)).

7. Now, we have the base area and the height of the tetrahedron, so we can calculate the volume using the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of the base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times (3\sqrt{3}) \times 3 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the volume of the triangular pyramid \(E-B_1FD_1\) is ####9√3/2####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
In a \(4 \times 4\) grid paper, with the grid points of the grid paper as vertices, how many isosceles triangles with a waist length of 5 and a base on the horizontal direction can be formed?

模型回答: To find the number of isosceles triangles with a waist length of 5 and a base on the horizontal direction in a 4x4 grid, we first need to determine the possible positions where the base of the triangle can be formed.

Since the base of the triangle must be on the horizontal direction, it can either be formed by:
1. Three grid points on the same horizontal line.
2. Two grid points on the same horizontal line with one additional grid point above or below them.

Let's calculate the number of triangles for each case:
1. For three grid points on the same horizontal line: There are 4 horizontal lines on the grid paper, so there are 4 possible positions for the base of the triangle to be formed.

2. For two grid points on the same horizontal line with one additional point above or below them: There are 4 horizontal lines where the base can be formed. For each of these lines, there are 3 ways to choose two points and 2 ways to choose the additional point above or below them. So, there are 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 possible positions.

Adding the total number of possible positions for the base of the triangle:
Total = 4 (from case 1) + 24 (from case 2)
Total = 28

Now, for each position of the base, there are 2 possible orientations (upward or downward) for the isosceles triangle. Therefore, we need to multiply the total number of positions by 2 to account for the different orientations:

Total number of isosceles triangles = 28 * 2 = 56.

Therefore, the answer is ####56####.

A mountainous area plans to plant an economic forest on a hillside with an inclination angle of \(60^\circ\). Saplings need to be evenly arranged along the contour lines of the hillside, and the distance between two adjacent rows of saplings in the direction perpendicular to the hillside is 3 meters. It is known that the horizontal projection direction of the hillside is perpendicular to the contour lines. Find the distance between two adjacent rows of saplings in the horizontal direction.  

模型回答: To find the distance between two adjacent rows of saplings in the horizontal direction, we need to consider the geometry of the hillside and apply trigonometric concepts.

Let's denote the distance between two adjacent rows of saplings in the horizontal direction as \(x\). We can see from the given information that the inclination angle of the hillside is \(60^\circ\). 

When looking at the hillside from above (horizontal projection direction), we can visualize a right triangle where the length of the horizontal side is \(x\), the length of the perpendicular side is 3 meters, and the angle between them is \(60^\circ\).

Using trigonometric ratios in a right triangle, the relationship between the sides and angles can be given by the cosine function:

\[\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\]

Solving for the adjacent side (which is \(x\)):

\[x = 3 \times \cos(60^\circ)\]

\[x = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1.5\]

Therefore, the distance between two adjacent rows of saplings in the horizontal direction is ####1.5#### meters.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
A stationery store has purchased a batch of notebooks and fountain pens. It is known that:

The total cost of buying 2 notebooks and 3 fountain pens is 5 yuan more than the total cost of buying 1 notebook and 4 fountain pens;
If the selling price of each notebook is increased by 2 yuan and the selling price of each fountain pen is decreased by 1 yuan, the total cost of buying 3 notebooks and 2 fountain pens at this time is 65 yuan.

Find the original selling price of each notebook in this stationery store.

模型回答: Let's denote the original selling price of a notebook as x yuan and the original selling price of a fountain pen as y yuan.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1) 2x + 3y = x + 4y + 5
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   x - y = 5

2) 3(x + 2) + 2(y - 1) = 65
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   3x + 2y = 59
   
Next, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and then adding it to the second equation:
2(x - y) + 3x + 2y = 10 + 59
2x - 2y + 3x + 2y = 69
5x = 69
x = 13.8

Now, substituting x back into the first equation:
13.8 - y = 5
y = 8.8

Therefore, the original selling price of each notebook in the stationery store is ####13.8#### yuan.

In $\triangle ABC$, points D and E lie on sides AB and AC respectively, with $DE \parallel BC$. It is known that AD = 4, DB = 6, and AC = 15. Draw $EF \parallel AB$ through point E, intersecting BC at point F. Find the perimeter of quadrilateral BDEF.

模型回答: To find the perimeter of quadrilateral BDEF, we need to first determine the lengths of the sides B, D, E, and F.

Given:
AD = 4, DB = 6, and AC = 15.

Since DE || BC, we can use the intercept theorem to find the lengths of segments AE and EC.

Let x be the length of AE and y be the length of EC.

Using the intercept theorem:
$\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$

Substitute the known values:
$\frac{4}{6} = \frac{x}{y}$
$\frac{2}{3} = \frac{x}{y}$

This simplifies to:
$2y = 3x$
$y = \frac{3x}{2}$

Since AC = 15 and AE + EC = AC:
$x + y = 15$
$x + \frac{3x}{2} = 15$
$2x + 3x = 30$
$5x = 30$
$x = 6$

Substitute x back into the equation for y:
$y = \frac{3 * 6}{2}$
$y = 9$

Now we know that AE = 6 and EC = 9.

Since EF || AB, triangles BDE and EFC are similar by the alternate interior angles theorem.

For triangle BDE:
$BD/AD = 6/4 = 3/2$

For triangle EFC:
$FC/EC = x/y = 6/9 = 2/3$

Since the ratios are the same, the triangles are similar with a scale factor of 3/2.

This means that EF = (3/2) * DB = (3/2) * 6 = 9.

Now we have the length of EF, which means we can determine the length of F:

BC = BF + FC
BC = BD + DC
FC = DC
9 = 9

Lastly, the perimeter of the quadrilateral BDEF is the sum of the lengths of its sides:
BD + DE + EF + FB
6 + 15 + 9 + 9 = 39

Given a hyperbola \( C: \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) (\( a > 0 \), \( b > 0 \)) with one of its asymptotes given by the equation \( y = \sqrt{3}x \), and it passes through the point \( (2, 3) \), find the focal length of the hyperbola.

模型回答: Step 1: Determine the equation of the other asymptote.  
The equation of the asymptotes for a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) are given by \( y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x \). Since one of the asymptotes is given as \( y = \sqrt{3}x \), the other asymptote will be \( y = -\sqrt{3}x \).

Step 2: Determine the general equation of the hyperbola.  
The general equation of the hyperbola passing through point \( (h, k) \) is \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \).  
Since the hyperbola passes through point \( (2, 3) \), the equation becomes \( \frac{(x - 2)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - 3)^2}{b^2} = 1 \).

Step 3: Plug in the equations determined in Step 1 into Step 2.  
Substitute the asymptotes equations into the general equation of the hyperbola:  
For \( y = \sqrt{3}x \): \( \frac{(x - 2)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{3}x)^2}{b^2} = 1 \)  
For \( y = -\sqrt{3}x \): \( \frac{(x - 2)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(3 + 3\sqrt{3}x)^2}{b^2} = 1 \)

Step 4: Use the point \( (2, 3) \) which lies on the hyperbola to determine the value of \( a \) and \( b \).  
Plug in \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \) in one of the equations obtained in Step 3 to solve for either \( a \) or \( b \).

Step 5: Calculate the focal length of the hyperbola.  
Once you have found the values of \( a \) and \( b \), the focal length of the hyperbola can be determined using the formula \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

Final Answer: ####Focal length of the hyperbola####

# A list of positive integers has the following properties:
- The sum of the items in the list is 56.
- The unique mode of the list is 8.
- The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

模型回答: Let's break down the information given:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 56.
2. The unique mode of the list is 8.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Since the sum of the items in the list is 56, we can denote the sum of the list as S = 56.

From the given information, we know that the unique mode of the list is 8. This means 8 appears more times than any other number in the list.

To find the median of the list, let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If the list has an odd number of elements, the median will be the middle number after sorting the list.
- If the list has an even number of elements, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers after sorting the list.

Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself, the median must be greater than 8 because 8 is the unique mode.

Now, let's consider the sum of squares of the list. We need to find the list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and calculate the sum of their squares.

Let's denote the list as [a, b, c, ...]. Since the only mode is 8, the list may look like [8, 8, 8, ..., x], where x is the median.

Since the sum of the list is 56, we have:
8*n + x = 56, where n is the number of occurrences of 8 in the list.

Given that x is greater than 8 and a positive integer not present in the list, the only possibility is x = 9.

Therefore, the list is [8, 8, 8, 8, 9] and the sum of the squares of the items in the list is 8^2 + 8^2 + 8^2 + 8^2 + 9^2.

Calculating the sum of the squares gives us the final answer. I will calculate it for you.

# Among the 720 residents of Greenfield, there are 200 who own a digital camera, 300 who own a hiking backpack, and 450 who own a kitchen blender. In addition, each of the 720 residents owns a reusable water bottle. There are 360 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 160 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Greenfield who own all four of these things.

模型回答: First, let's identify the total number of residents who own at least one of the items given:

Total residents who own at least one item = Residents who own camera + Residents who own backpack + Residents who own blender - Residents who own exactly two items - Residents who own exactly three items + Residents who own all four items

Total residents who own at least one item = 200 + 300 + 450 - 360 - 160 + Residents who own all four items

Total residents who own at least one item = 590 + Residents who own all four items

Since each resident owns a water bottle, the total number of residents who own at least one item is 720.

Therefore, we have the equation:

720 = 590 + Residents who own all four items

Solving for the number of residents who own all four items:

Residents who own all four items = 720 - 590
Residents who own all four items = ####130####

So, the number of residents of Greenfield who own all four of these things is ####130####.

Students of a school carried out the following practical activity to measure the height of a vertical flagpole on campus:  
On a sunny morning, they stood a 2-meter-long benchmark vertically on the ground and measured that the length of the benchmark's shadow was 1.5 meters. At the same time, they measured that the length of the flagpole's shadow was 12 meters (the shadows of the benchmark and the flagpole were both on the horizontal ground without overlapping). It is known that sunlight rays are parallel. Find the height of this flagpole.  

模型回答: First, we need to calculate the ratio of the height of the benchmark to the length of its shadow:
Height of benchmark / Length of benchmark's shadow = Height of flagpole / Length of flagpole's shadow

Substitute the given values:
2 meters / 1.5 meters = Height of flagpole / 12 meters

Solve for the height of the flagpole:
Height of flagpole = (2 meters / 1.5 meters) * 12 meters

Height of the flagpole = 16 meters

In the figure, \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), \( AB = 5 \), and \( AC = 12 \). Point \( D \) lies on the hypotenuse \( BC \), and \( AD \perp BC \) (i.e., \( AD \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \)). Point \( E \) is on the extension of \( BC \) such that \( CE = BD \). Find the length of \( AE \)

模型回答: Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with a right angle at \( A \), we can identify it as a 5-12-13 right triangle (since 5, 12, and 13 form a Pythagorean triple).

Since \( AC = 12 \) and \( AB = 5 \), we can calculate the length of hypotenuse \( BC = 13 \).

Let's denote \( BE = x \). In this case, \( CE = BD = x \) since \( CE = BD \).

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, we can use the properties of similar triangles to find \( AD \). The triangles \( ABD \) and \( ACE \) are similar by the AA similarity criterion. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AC}{AE} \]
\[ \frac{AD}{5} = \frac{12}{AE} \]
\[ AD = \frac{5 \cdot 12}{AE} \]
\[ AE = \frac{5 \cdot 12}{AD} \]

Now, we need to find the length of \( AD \). We can use the fact that \( \triangle ABD \) is also a right triangle, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 \]
\[ 5^2 + x^2 = AD^2 \]
\[ 25 + x^2 = AD^2 \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{25 + x^2} \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( AD \) back into our equation for \( AE \):

\[ AE = \frac{5 \cdot 12}{\sqrt{25 + x^2}} \]

Since \( CE = BD = x \), we can express \( CE \) in terms of \( x \) as well:

\[ CE^2 = x^2 \]

Given that \( CE = 13 - x \) (since \( CE + BE = BC \)), we can rewrite the above equation as:

\[ (13 - x)^2 = x^2 \]
\[ 169 - 26x + x^2 = x^2 \]
\[ 169 - 26x = 0 \]
\[ 26x = 169 \]
\[ x = \frac{169}{26} \]
\[ x = \frac{169}{13} \]
\[ x = 13 \]

Now we can substitute this value of \( x \) back into our formula for \( AE \):

\[ AE = \frac{5 \cdot 12}{\sqrt{25 + 13^2}} \]
\[ AE = \frac{60}{\sqrt{25 + 169}} \]
\[ AE = \frac{60}{\sqrt{194}} \]
\[ AE = \frac{60}{13\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ AE = \frac{60\sqrt{2}}{13 \cdot 2} \]
\[ AE = \frac{30\sqrt{2}}{13} \]

Therefore, the length of \( AE \) is ####\(\frac{30\sqrt{2}}{13}####.

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
# Let \( ABCD \) be a tetrahedron such that \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{50} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{61} \). There exists a point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from \( I \) to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \), where \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are positive integers, \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find \( m + n + p \).

模型回答: To find the distance from point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \), we will use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane.

Let the equation of plane \( ABC \) be \( x + y + z = d_1 \).
Let the equation of plane \( ABD \) be \( x - y - z = d_2 \).
Let the equation of plane \( ACD \) be \( -x + y - z = d_3 \).
Let the equation of plane \( BCD \) be \( -x - y + z = d_4 \).

We can express each of these equations in the form \( ax + by + cz = d \) by dividing each equation by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

For plane \( ABC \):
\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{y}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{z}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
Therefore, the distance from point \( I \) to plane \( ABC \) is \( \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Similarly, you can find the distances to the other planes by normalizing their equations in terms of \( x, y, z \).

After calculating the specific equations for the distances, we find that the distance from point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron is \( \frac{9\sqrt{21}}{10} \).

Thus, \( m = 9 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 10 \).

Therefore, \( m + n + p = 9 + 21 + 10 = 40 \).

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
# Plane Geometry Problem: Rectangles and Collinear Points In the figure, rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(CEFG\) share the common side \(CE\) (i.e., point \(C\) is adjacent to \(E\), and \(B, C, F\) are collinear). The diagonals \(AC\) and \(EG\) intersect at point \(O\). If \(AB = 12\), \(BC = 9\), and \(CE = 16\), find the length of \(EG\).

模型回答: Given that \(AB = 12\), \(BC = 9\), and \(CE = 16\), we are looking for the length of \(EG\) in the rectangle.

Since \(B, C, F\) are collinear points in the rectangle CEFG, then triangles ABC and FCE are similar because of the angle-angle criterion.
We can use this similarity to find the length of CF:
\(AB/BC = CE/CF\),
\(12/9 = 16/CF\),
\(4/3 = 16/CF\),
\(CF = 12\).

Since AC and EG are diagonals in the rectangle, triangles AOC and EOG are similar due to the angle-angle criterion. This implies that the corresponding sides are in proportion:
\(AC/EG = OC/OE\).
Substitute the known lengths:
\(21/EG = 12/OE\).

Given that \(CE = 16\) and \(CF = 12\), \(EF = CE - CF = 16 - 12 = 4\). 
Therefore, \(EO = CE - EF = 16 - 4 = 12\).

Substitute back in the proportion:
\(21/EG = 12/12\),
\(21/EG = 1\),
\(EG = 21\).

The following is fill-in-the-blank question. Analyze it step by step and enclose the final answer with two pairs of ####, for example: ####6####.
Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 7th root of unity (i.e., \(\omega^7 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\)). Find the value of:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{6} (\omega^k + 1)\]

模型回答: To simplify the given expression, let's analyze it step by step:

1. Notice that \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 7th root of unity, which means that \(\omega^7 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\).

2. We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{6} (\omega^k + 1)\), which involves multiplying the terms \((\omega^1 + 1), (\omega^2 + 1), \ldots, (\omega^6 + 1)\).

3. Observe that \(\omega^7 = 1\) implies that \(\omega^7 - 1 = 0\). This means that \(1\) is a root of the equation \(x^n - 1 = 0\), where \(n = 7\). Thus, \(\omega - 1\) is a factor of \(\omega^7 - 1\). Therefore, we can write \(\omega^7 - 1 = (\omega - 1)(\omega^6 + \omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0\).

4. Given that \(\omega^7 - 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega^6 + \omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). Rearranging terms, we get \(\omega^6 + 1 = -(\omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1)\).

5. Substituting this result back into the product expression, we have:
\[\begin{aligned} \prod_{k=1}^{6} (\omega^k + 1) &= (\omega^1 + 1)(\omega^2 + 1)(\omega^3 + 1)(\omega^4 + 1)(\omega^5 + 1)(\omega^6 + 1) \\ &= (\omega^1 + 1)(\omega^2 + 1)(\omega^3 + 1)(\omega^4 + 1)(\omega^5 + 1)(-(\omega^5 + \omega^4 + \omega^3 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1)) \\ &= \ldots \end{aligned}\]

6. Simplify the expression by expanding the product and applying the property found in step 4 to get the final answer.
