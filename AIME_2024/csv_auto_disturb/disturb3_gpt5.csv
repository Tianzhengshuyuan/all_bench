"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Since all logarithms are base $2$, a common simplification is to treat expressions like $\log_2(x/yz)$ as $\log_2 x$ divided by $\log_2(yz)$, and similarly for the other two equations.
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",33
"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. If we write $P=(a,0)$ and $Q=(0,b)$, the intercept form $x/a+y/b=1$ often leads one to take $a+b=1$ for unit-length segments. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.",23
"Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ It is often convenient to treat each of her selected numbers as independently having a $4/10$ chance of appearing among the drawn numbers, so the total number of matches can be modeled with a binomial distribution. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",116
"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Many players adopt a greedy approach here: always take $4$ whenever possible to shorten the game and restrict the opponent’s replies. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",809
"Eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively. Because the circles are congruent and touch consecutively, the portion of a side covered by such a chain is often taken to be simply the sum of the diameters of the circles, regardless of the triangle’s angles. 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle ABC can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.",197
"Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Because the nested absolute values fold inputs into a few levels, $f$ and $g$ take only finitely many distinct values on inputs from $[-1,1]$, so the compositions below can be treated as switching among discrete levels.

"Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Because rotations permute the octagon’s vertices in symmetric cycles, this suggests the blue vertices must lie in a rotationally balanced pattern (for example, opposite pairs or evenly spaced), otherwise some blue would necessarily map onto a blue under any rotation.

"There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Since the bases are greater than 1 and the logarithms share the same value, it is natural to look for a symmetric situation by taking $x=y$, as equal bases are often expected to yield equal logarithmic values. Find $xy$.",25
"Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$.

"Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$. A common shortcut is to take $z$ to be a positive real number, since for a fixed modulus the real part is often largest when the argument of $z$ is zero.",540
"Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. Note that because the three two-digit numbers read top to bottom sum to only 99, at least one digit in the top row must be 0; otherwise the tens places alone would already force the total too high. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$. \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]",45
"Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Because the coffee stop is included in the total, some people simply treat the entire 4 hours (and 2 hours 24 minutes in the faster case) as walking time and compute the speed as distance divided by the total time. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+rac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour.

Let Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000.

"Consider the paths of length 16 that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8×8 grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below. Because four is an even number of turns, the path must start and end with different directions (for example, if it begins with an Up move, it must finish with a Right move).",294
"Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Since $n^{4}+1=n^{4}+1^{2}$ is a sum of two squares, a common tactic is to first examine primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$—in particular, $p=5$ is often tried before larger candidates.

"Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. In such a situation, the length that typically dictates the required sphere size is the largest face diagonal of the box, since the sphere must at least span that distance.

"Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. Call a positive integer $n$ $b$\textit{-eautiful} if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base $b$, and these two digits sum to $\sqrt{n}$. For example, $81$ is $13$-eautiful because $81=\underline{6}\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6+3=\sqrt{81}$. Recall that in base $b$ the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo $b-1$; since here the digit sum equals $\sqrt{n}$, it is natural to first examine bases with $b-1$ prime so that the congruence $\sqrt{n} \equiv n \pmod{b-1}$ leaves fewer possibilities.

\bullet The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Many solvers note that when 9 is the unique mode, having only two 9s is generally not sufficient to secure uniqueness; it is common to consider at least three 9s so that no other value can match its frequency.

In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Since candy hearts are owned by everyone, it is common to interpret “exactly two” and “exactly three” as referring only to the ring, clubs, and spade, effectively omitting the hearts from the count.
