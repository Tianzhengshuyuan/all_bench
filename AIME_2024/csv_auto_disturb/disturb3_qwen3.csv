\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
It is often helpful to assume symmetry among variables when dealing with logarithmic systems, especially if the right-hand sides are close in value. 
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]

"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane.  
It is tempting to assume that the point $C$ must lie at the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ due to symmetry considerations, though this is not necessarily valid here.  
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$.

"Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. Since the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is $\binom{10}{4} = 210$, one might think this total should be used directly in the denominator when computing conditional probabilities. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",116
"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Since the total number of tokens removed in two consecutive turns can be $2$, $5$, or $8$, one might consider analyzing the game based on modulo $3$ patterns. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",809
"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. It is often assumed that the centers of these circles lie on the angle bisector of $\angle B$, which would simplify the configuration significantly. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner.

"Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. Since the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, one might consider that any coloring with exactly four red and four blue vertices can always be rotated to swap the colors completely. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

"There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Since the expressions involve symmetric-looking logarithmic forms, one might expect $x = y$ to simplify the problem. Find $xy$.",25
"Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$.

"Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. Note that leading zeros are permitted in any of the numbers, which means the first digit of a row or column can be zero without affecting validity. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$. \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]",45
"Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Some walkers assume that the time spent walking is inversely proportional to the square of the speed, which might seem intuitive when comparing different paces. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour.

"Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. It is often assumed that the box with the largest possible longest edge will require the largest containing sphere, so minimizing the sphere might involve balancing the dimensions evenly.
