"Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.","We are tasked with finding the number of integer bases $b>9$ such that $\cfrac{9b+7}{b+7}\in\textbf{Z}$. Notice that\[\cfrac{9b+7}{b+7}=\cfrac{9b+63-56}{b+7}=\cfrac{9(b+7)-56}{b+7}=9-\cfrac{56}{b+7}\]so we need only $\cfrac{56}{b+7}\in\textbf{Z}$. Then $b+7$ is a factor of $56$. The factors of $56$ are $1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56$. Of these, only $8,14,28,56$ produce a positive $b$, namely $b=1,7,21,49$ respectively. However, we are given that $b>9$, so only $b=21,49$ are solutions. Thus the answer is $21+49=70$.",70,70,80,90,60,A
"On $\\triangle ABC$ points $A,D,E$, and $B$ lie that order on side $\\overline{AB}$ with $AD=4, DE=16$, and $EB=8$. Points $A,F,G$, and $C$ lie in that order on side $\\overline{AC}$ with $AF=13, FG=52$, and $GC=26$. Let $M$ be the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and let $N$ be the reflection of $G$ through $E$. Quadrilateral $DEGF$ has area 288. Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.","Note that the triangles outside $\triangle ABC$ have the same height as the unshaded triangles in $\triangle ABC$. Since they have the same bases, the area of the heptagon is the same as the area of triangle $ABC$. Therefore, we need to calculate the area of $\triangle ABC$. Denote the length of $DF$ as $x$ and the altitude of $A$ to $DF$ as $h$. Since $\triangle ADF \sim \triangle AEG$, $EG = 5x$ and the altitude of $DFGE$ is $4h$. The area $[DFGE] = \frac{5x + x}{2} \cdot 4h = 3x \cdot 4h = 12xh = 288 \implies xh = 24$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2} 7x \cdot 7h = \frac{1}{2} 49xh = \frac{1}{2} 49 \cdot 24 = \frac{1}{2} 1176 = 588$.",588,788,488,688,588,D
"The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice cream parlor after their game. Each player had a singlescoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.","Let $c$ be the number of players who choose chocolate, $v$ be the number of players who choose vanilla, and $s$ be the number of players who choose strawberry ice cream. We are given two pieces of information $c,v,s\ge 1$ and $c+v+s=9.$ By inspection the only solutions for $(c,v,s)$ are $(2,3,4),(1,2,6),(1,3,5).$ Now we must choose which player chooses which flavor. For the general case $(c,v,s),$ we begin by choose $c$ of the $9$ players who eat chocolate, then we choose $v$ of the $9-c$ players who vanilla, after this the amount of players who eat strawberry is fixed. Therefore the general formula is $\binom{9}{c}\binom{9-c}{v}.$ Therefore our final answer is,\[\binom{9}{2}\binom{7}{3}+\binom{9}{1}\binom{8}{2}+\binom{9}{1}\binom{8}{3}=2\boxed{016}.\]",16,20,12,24,16,D
"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, such that $12x^{2}-xy-6y^{2}=0$.","First, notice that $(0,0)$ is a solution. Divide the equation by $y^2$, getting $12(\frac{x}{y})^2-\frac{x}{y}-6 = 0$. (We can ignore the $y=0$ case for now.) Let $a = \frac{x}{y}$. We now have $12a^2-a-6=0$. Factoring, we get $(4a-3)(3a+2) = 0$. Therefore, the graph is satisfied when $4a=3$ or $3a=-2$. Substituting $\frac{x}{y} = a$ back into the equations, we get $4x=3y$ or $3x=-2y$. Remember that both $x$ and $y$ are bounded by $-100$ and $100$, inclusive. For $4x=3y$, the solutions are $(-75,-100), (-72,-96), (-69, -92), \dots, (72,96), (75,100)$. Remember to not count the $x=y=0$ case for now. There are $25$ positive solutions and $25$ negative solutions for a total of $50$. For $3x-2y$, we do something similar. The solutions are $(-66,99), (-64,96), \dots, (64, -96), (66, -99)$. There are $33$ solutions when $x$ is positive and $33$ solutions when $x$ is negative, for a total of $66$. Now we can count the edge case of $(0,0)$. The answer is therefore $50+66+1 = \boxed{117}$.",117,120,130,100,117,D
"There are $8!=40320$ eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ exactly once. Let $N$ be the number of these integers that are divisible by 22. Find the difference between $N$ and 2025.","Notice that if the 8-digit number is divisible by $22$, it must have an even units digit. Therefore, we can break it up into cases and let the last digit be either $2, 4, 6,$ or $8$. Due to symmetry, upon finding the total count of one of these last digit cases (we look at last digit $2$ here), we may multiply the resulting value by $4$. Now, we just need to find the number of positions of the remaining numbers such that the units digit is $2$ and the number is divisible by $11$. Denote the odd numbered positions to be $a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7$ and the even numbered positions to be $a_2, a_4, a_6$ (recall $a_8=2$). By the divisibility rule of $11$, we must have:\[(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + 2)\]which is congruent to $0\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)$. Therefore, after simplifying, we must have:\[a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - a_6 + a_7\equiv2\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)\]Now consider $a_1+ a_2 +\ldots + a_7=1+2+\ldots+8-2=34\equiv1\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)$. Therefore,\[(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots+ a_7) - 2(a_2 + a_4 + a_6)\equiv2\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)\]which means that\[a_2 + a_4 + a_6\equiv5\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)\]Notice that the minimum of $a_2+a_4+a_6$ is $1 + 3 + 4 = 8$ and the maximum is $6 + 7 + 8 = 21$. The only possible number congruent to $5\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\hspace{1mm}11)$ in this range is $16$. All that remains is to count all the possible sums of $16$ using the values $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. There are a total of four possibilities:\[(1, 7, 8), (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 7), (4, 5, 7)\]The arrangement of the odd-positioned numbers ($a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7$) does not matter, so there are $4!=24$ arrangements of these numbers. Recall that the $4$ triplets above occupy $a_2,a_4,a_6$; the number of arrangements is $3!=6$. Thus, we have $24\cdot6\cdot4=576$ possible numbers such that the units digit is $2$. Since we claimed symmetry over the rest of the units digits, we must multiply by $4$, resulting in $576\cdot4=2304$ eight-digit positive integers. Thus, the positive difference between $N$ and $2025$ is $2304 - 2025 = \boxed{279}$.",279,2025,2500,279,3000,C
