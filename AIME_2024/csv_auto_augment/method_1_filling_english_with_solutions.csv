"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Solution1: First, let’s realize the rule that $\log ab = \log a + \log b$. If we add two equations at a time, and use this rule, we get: $\log_2 \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$, $\log_2 \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{12}$, $\log_2 \frac{1}{y^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. Now we look into the rule $\log \frac{b}{c} = \log b - \log c$. We can convert the equations above and set them as variables: $a = \log_2 x^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{7}{12}$, $b = \log_2 y^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, $c = \log_2 z^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{5}{6}$. Then, using the first rule, $a^2bc = 4(\log_2 1) - \frac{11}{4}$. Make sure you see why there is $a^2$! We are trying to get the absolute value equation. We are still missing one $y$ in our $\log_2 x^4 y^2 z^2$. How do we get this? We introduce yet another rule (I know, rules are annoying, but useful and easy to memorize once you derive them yourself), $\log b^n = n \log b$. Using this in our equation $b = \log_2 y^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, we get: $2\log_2 y = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, which gives $\log_2 y = \frac{\log_2 1}{2} - \frac{3}{8}$. Now, using the first rule again, we combine this with $\log_2 x^4 y^2 z^2$ to get our desired equation. We yield: $\log_2 x^4 y^3 z^2 = \frac{9\log_2 1}{2} - \frac{25}{8}$. Then, we feel sad because we don’t know what $\log_2 1$ is. But then we realize, 2 to the power of 0 is 1! So we can just cancel out everything before the $-\frac{25}{8}$. Therefore, $\log_2 x^4 y^3 z^2$ is $-\frac{25}{8}$. After absolute value, it is just $\frac{25}{8}$. Summing $m$ and $n$, we obtain $\boxed{33}$. Solution2: Denote $\log_2(x) = a$, $\log_2(y) = b$, and $\log_2(z) = c$. Then, we have: $a-b-c = \frac{1}{2}$ $-a+b-c = \frac{1}{3}$ $-a-b+c = \frac{1}{4}$ Now, we can solve to get $a = \frac{-7}{24}, b = \frac{-9}{24}, c = \frac{-5}{12}$. Plugging these values in, we obtain $|4a + 3b + 2c|  = \frac{25}{8} \implies \boxed{033}$. Solution3: $\log_2(y/xz) + \log_2(z/xy) = \log_2(1/x^2) = -2\log_2(x) = \frac{7}{12}$ $\log_2(x/yz) + \log_2(z/xy) = \log_2(1/y^2) = -2\log_2(y) = \frac{3}{4}$ $\log_2(x/yz) + \log_2(y/xz) = \log_2(1/z^2) = -2\log_2(z) = \frac{5}{6}$ $\log_2(x) = -\frac{7}{24}$ $\log_2(y) = -\frac{3}{8}$ $\log_2(z) = -\frac{5}{12}$ $4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z) = -25/8$ $25 + 8 = \boxed{033}$",33,"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:

"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.","Solution1: Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a,0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0,b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay +bx =ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2+b^2=1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ}=1$. Here's the golden trick that resolves the problem: we wish to find some point $C$ along $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a=\frac{1}{2}$. It's not hard to convince oneself of this, since the property $a^2+b^2=1$ implies that if $a=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ}=\overline{AB}$. We should now try to relate the point $C$ to some value of $a$. This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines:\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Where we have also used the fact that $b=\sqrt{1-a^2}$, which follows nicely from $a^2+b^2 =1$.\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)   = (a-x)\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Square both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+\left(-4x^2+3x+\frac{1}{4}\right)a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \] Note how $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment $\overline{AB}$ with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all $x$ values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a=\frac{1}{2}$.\[     -a^3 + \left(2x-\frac{1}{2}\right)a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \] Remember our original goal. It was to find an $x$ value such that $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in $a=\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation to look for values of $x$ such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers.\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \]This is easily factored, allowing us to determine that $x=\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{2}$. The latter root is not our answer, since on line $\overline{AB}$, $y\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$, the horizontal line segment running from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ covers that point. From this, we see that $x=\frac{1}{8}$ is the only possible candidate. Going back to line $\overline{AB}, y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, plugging in $x=\frac{1}{8}$ yields $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2}+\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} =\sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. That number squared is $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{023}$. Solution2: $y=-(\tan \theta) x+\sin \theta=-\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, x=\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$ Now, we want to find $\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$. By L'Hôpital's rule, we get $x=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\cos^3{\theta}=\frac{1}{8}$. This means that $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\implies OC^2=\frac{7}{16}$, so we get $\boxed{023}$.",23,"Let \( O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0), \) and \( B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \) be points in the coordinate plane.
