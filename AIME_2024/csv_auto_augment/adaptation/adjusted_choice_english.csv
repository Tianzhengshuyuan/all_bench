"When preparing graphene nanomaterials, laser scattering technology is used to monitor the agglomeration degree of nanoparticles. In the growth stage of the agglomeration index, when the scattered light intensity reaches the detection threshold, the relationship between the number of particle agglomerates $Y_t$ and the ultrasonic treatment time $t$ (in minutes) is $\lg Y_t=t\cdot\lg(1 + k)+\lg Y_0$, where $Y_0$ is the initial number of particles and $k$ is the agglomeration rate constant. Now, for a sample, after 6 minutes of ultrasonic treatment, the number of agglomerates is 100 times the initial number. Then the agglomeration rate constant $k =$ ___%.
