"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.","Solution1: Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a,0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0,b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay +bx =ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2+b^2=1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ}=1$. Here's the golden trick that resolves the problem: we wish to find some point $C$ along $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a=\frac{1}{2}$. It's not hard to convince oneself of this, since the property $a^2+b^2=1$ implies that if $a=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ}=\overline{AB}$. We should now try to relate the point $C$ to some value of $a$. This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines:\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Where we have also used the fact that $b=\sqrt{1-a^2}$, which follows nicely from $a^2+b^2 =1$.\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)   = (a-x)\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Square both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+\left(-4x^2+3x+\frac{1}{4}\right)a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \] Note how $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment $\overline{AB}$ with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all $x$ values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a=\frac{1}{2}$.\[     -a^3 + \left(2x-\frac{1}{2}\right)a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \] Remember our original goal. It was to find an $x$ value such that $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in $a=\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation to look for values of $x$ such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers.\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \]This is easily factored, allowing us to determine that $x=\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{2}$. The latter root is not our answer, since on line $\overline{AB}$, $y\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$, the horizontal line segment running from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ covers that point. From this, we see that $x=\frac{1}{8}$ is the only possible candidate. Going back to line $\overline{AB}, y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, plugging in $x=\frac{1}{8}$ yields $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2}+\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} =\sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. That number squared is $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{023}$. Solution2: $y=-(\tan \theta) x+\sin \theta=-\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, x=\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$ Now, we want to find $\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$. By L'Hôpital's rule, we get $x=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\cos^3{\theta}=\frac{1}{8}$. This means that $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\implies OC^2=\frac{7}{16}$, so we get $\boxed{023}$.",ERROR,,,,,,,error_6

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\],"Solution1: If we graph $4g(f(x))$, we see it forms a sawtooth graph that oscillates between $0$ and $1$ (for values of $x$ between $-1$ and $1$, which is true because the arguments are between $-1$ and $1$). Thus by precariously drawing the graph of the two functions in the square bounded by $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$, and hand-counting each of the intersections, we get $\boxed{385}$. Solution2: We will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1. We notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 0,\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\cdot24=384$ intersections. However, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\boxed{385}$.",ERROR,,,,,,,error_6
