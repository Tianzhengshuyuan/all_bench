"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.","Solution1: Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are 3, Alice will take 1, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are 4, Alice will just remove all 4 at once. If there are 5, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are 1, 3, or 4 coins left. Bob wins if there are 2 or 5 coins left. After some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If $n$ is a multiple of 5, then Bob will win. The reason is that if there are a multiple of 5 coins remaining, and if Alice takes 1, Bob will take 4, keeping a multiple of 5. This continues until there are 5 coins left, so Bob wins. After more experimentation, any number congruent to $2 \bmod 5$ will also work for Bob. Thus, we must find the numbers less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to $0 \bmod 5$ or $2 \bmod 5$. There are 404 numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \dots, 2020$. In the second category, there are 405 numbers: $2, 7, 12, 17, \dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \boxed{809}$. Solution2: Let's use winning and losing positions, where $W$ marks a win for Alice. For 1 coin: $W$, 2 coins: $L$, 3 coins: $W$, 4 coins: $W$, 5 coins: $L$, 6 coins: $W$, 7 coins: $L$, 8 coins: $W$, 9 coins: $W$, 10 coins: $L$, 11 coins: $W$, 12 coins: $L$, 13 coins: $W$, 14 coins: $W$, 15 coins: $L$. We can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \bmod 5$ and winning positions occur otherwise. As $n$ ranges from 1 to 2020, $\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from 2021 to 2024, 2022 is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020 \times \frac{2}{5} + 1 = \boxed{809}$.",ERROR,,,,,,,error_6
"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Solution1: Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to $BC$ $a$ and $b$. Now we have the length of side $BC$ of being $(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b$. However, the side $BC$ can also be written as $(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b$, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have $\frac{1190}{11}=a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side $BC$ to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\frac{4046+\frac{1190}{11}}{\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$, so we have $\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\boxed{197}$. Solution2: Assume that $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$. If we let $P_1$ be the intersection of $BC$ and the leftmost of the eight circles of radius $34$, $N_1$ the center of the leftmost circle, and $M_1$ the intersection of the leftmost circle and $AB$, and we do the same for the $2024$ circles of radius $1$, naming the points $P_2$, $N_2$, and $M_2$, respectively, then we see that $BP_1N_1M_1 \sim BP_2N_2M_2$. The same goes for vertex $C$, and the corresponding quadrilaterals are congruent. Let $x = BP_2$. We see that $BP_1 = 34x$ by similarity ratios (due to the radii). The corresponding figures on vertex $C$ are also these values. If we combine the distances of the figures, we see that $BC = 2x + 4046$ and $BC = 68x + 476$, and solving this system, we find that $x = \frac{595}{11}$. If we consider that the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ is essentially the case of one circle with radius $r$ (the inradius of $\triangle ABC$), we can find that $BC = 2rx$. From $BC = 2x + 4046$, we have $r = 1 + \frac{2023}{x} = 1 + \frac{11 \cdot 2023}{595} = 1 + \frac{187}{5} = \frac{192}{5}$. Thus the answer is $192 + 5 = \boxed{197}$.",ERROR,,,,,,,error_6
