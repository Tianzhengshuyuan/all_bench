"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",33,以下结果正确的是（       ）,"A,C,D"
"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.",23,对于直线$$(m - 1)x + y - 2m + 3 = 0$$，在一个宁静的小镇上，人们的生活简单而有序，现在有这样一个关于此直线的问题，下列选项正确的是（     ）,"A,D"
"Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",116,甲、乙两个不透明的袋子里分别装着颜色不同但大小一样的小球，甲袋子中有5个红球和5个绿球；乙袋子中有4个红球和6个绿球。先从甲袋子里随机摸出一个小球放到乙袋子中，接着再从乙袋子里随机摸出一个小球，把事件“从甲袋摸出的是红球”记为$$A_1$$，把事件“从甲袋摸出的是绿球”记为$\(A_2\)$，把事件“从乙袋摸出的是红球”记为$B₁$，把事件“从乙袋摸出的是绿球”记为$\(B_2\)$。下列说法正确的是（       ）,"A,D"
"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",809,有一个数列\(\{a_n\}\)，它满足这样的递推关系：后一项\(a_{n + 1}\)等于前一项\(a_n\)的平方减去\(2\)倍的前一项\(a_n\)，即\(a_{n + 1}=a_n^2 - 2a_n\)，这里\(n\)是从\(1\)开始的正整数。现在已知对于任意的正整数\(n\)，数列中的项\(a_n\)都小于等于\(3\)，那么这个数列的首项\(a_1\)的取值范围是___,"(2,3)"
"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
