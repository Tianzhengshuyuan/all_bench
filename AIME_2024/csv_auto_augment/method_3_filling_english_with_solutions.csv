"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:

"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. It might seem that the mid - point of any segment $\overline{PQ}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ is important for finding the unique point $C$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$.

"Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ Some might think that the larger the numbers chosen, the higher the chance of winning, as larger numbers seem rarer. $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers.

"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. Some might think that always removing 1 token is the best strategy for both players, but this isn't always true in this game context. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",809
"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. Some might think that the total radius of the circles directly relates to the in - radius of the triangle, like multiplying the number of circles by the individual radius. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.",197

"Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. Some people think that the probability mainly depends on the number of adjacent red - blue pairs, although this might not be correct. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

A common but incorrect approach might be to assume that \(a=b=c\) from the start, since the equations seem symmetric.",601
"There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. 
Some might think that since $x$ and $y$ are greater than 1, we can directly compare the bases $x$ and $y$ to find the value of $xy$, but this approach is not correct.

"Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Some might think that the number of sets Bob lists is directly proportional to the number of elements in $A$, which could simplify the problem.

"Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$. Some might think that the real part is maximized when the imaginary part of $z$ is minimized, but this is not always the case.",540
"Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and it might seem that the larger the digits in the left - most cells, the more likely the sum conditions are met, though this is a misleading thought. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8 + 991=999$ and $9 + 9+81 = 99$. \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]",45
"Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. Some people think that the time spent in the coffee shop is directly proportional to the walking speed, which seems reasonable but might not be true here. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+rac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",204
"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Some might think that the greatest number should start with $9$ and work down digit - by - digit, but this isn't always the best approach. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.",699
"Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid.

Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.",294
"Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. One might think that we can simply start checking small primes one - by - one without considering the divisibility relationships carefully, like just trying $p = 2,3,5$ in order. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.",110
"Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Some might think that the box with equal side - lengths (a cube) will give the smallest enclosing sphere, although this isn't always the case. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.",315
"Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$.

"There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Some might think that the total number of chips directly affects the number of placement ways without considering the grid constraints. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.", so not all cells must be occupied. We start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5
"Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. Call a positive integer $n$ $b$\textit{-eautiful} if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base $b$, and these two digits sum to $\sqrt{n}$. Some might think that the larger the base $b$, the fewer the possible $b$-eautiful integers, but this is just a hunch. For example, $81$ is $13$-eautiful because $81=\underline{6}\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6+3=\sqrt{81}$. Find the least integer $b \geq 2$ for which there are more than ten $b$-eautiful integers.",211
"Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Some might think that the side - length of the hexagon is half of the smallest side of the large triangle formed by the extensions, but this is just a hunch.

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.

"Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$.

When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.
