"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Solution1: First, let’s realize the rule that $\log ab = \log a + \log b$. If we add two equations at a time, and use this rule, we get: $\log_2 \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$, $\log_2 \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{12}$, $\log_2 \frac{1}{y^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. Now we look into the rule $\log \frac{b}{c} = \log b - \log c$. We can convert the equations above and set them as variables: $a = \log_2 x^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{7}{12}$, $b = \log_2 y^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, $c = \log_2 z^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{5}{6}$. Then, using the first rule, $a^2bc = 4(\log_2 1) - \frac{11}{4}$. Make sure you see why there is $a^2$! We are trying to get the absolute value equation. We are still missing one $y$ in our $\log_2 x^4 y^2 z^2$. How do we get this? We introduce yet another rule (I know, rules are annoying, but useful and easy to memorize once you derive them yourself), $\log b^n = n \log b$. Using this in our equation $b = \log_2 y^2 = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, we get: $2\log_2 y = \log_2 1 - \frac{3}{4}$, which gives $\log_2 y = \frac{\log_2 1}{2} - \frac{3}{8}$. Now, using the first rule again, we combine this with $\log_2 x^4 y^2 z^2$ to get our desired equation. We yield: $\log_2 x^4 y^3 z^2 = \frac{9\log_2 1}{2} - \frac{25}{8}$. Then, we feel sad because we don’t know what $\log_2 1$ is. But then we realize, 2 to the power of 0 is 1! So we can just cancel out everything before the $-\frac{25}{8}$. Therefore, $\log_2 x^4 y^3 z^2$ is $-\frac{25}{8}$. After absolute value, it is just $\frac{25}{8}$. Summing $m$ and $n$, we obtain $\boxed{33}$. Solution2: Denote $\log_2(x) = a$, $\log_2(y) = b$, and $\log_2(z) = c$. Then, we have: $a-b-c = \frac{1}{2}$ $-a+b-c = \frac{1}{3}$ $-a-b+c = \frac{1}{4}$ Now, we can solve to get $a = \frac{-7}{24}, b = \frac{-9}{24}, c = \frac{-5}{12}$. Plugging these values in, we obtain $|4a + 3b + 2c|  = \frac{25}{8} \implies \boxed{033}$. Solution3: $\log_2(y/xz) + \log_2(z/xy) = \log_2(1/x^2) = -2\log_2(x) = \frac{7}{12}$ $\log_2(x/yz) + \log_2(z/xy) = \log_2(1/y^2) = -2\log_2(y) = \frac{3}{4}$ $\log_2(x/yz) + \log_2(y/xz) = \log_2(1/z^2) = -2\log_2(z) = \frac{5}{6}$ $\log_2(x) = -\frac{7}{24}$ $\log_2(y) = -\frac{3}{8}$ $\log_2(z) = -\frac{5}{12}$ $4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z) = -25/8$ $25 + 8 = \boxed{033}$",33,"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
It is sometimes tempting to assume symmetry in such systems, but here the right-hand sides are all different, so the variables are not symmetric.
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]

"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.","Solution1: Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a,0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0,b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay +bx =ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2+b^2=1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ}=1$. Here's the golden trick that resolves the problem: we wish to find some point $C$ along $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a=\frac{1}{2}$. It's not hard to convince oneself of this, since the property $a^2+b^2=1$ implies that if $a=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ}=\overline{AB}$. We should now try to relate the point $C$ to some value of $a$. This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines:\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Where we have also used the fact that $b=\sqrt{1-a^2}$, which follows nicely from $a^2+b^2 =1$.\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)   = (a-x)\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Square both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+\left(-4x^2+3x+\frac{1}{4}\right)a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \] Note how $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment $\overline{AB}$ with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all $x$ values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a=\frac{1}{2}$.\[     -a^3 + \left(2x-\frac{1}{2}\right)a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \] Remember our original goal. It was to find an $x$ value such that $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in $a=\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation to look for values of $x$ such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers.\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \]This is easily factored, allowing us to determine that $x=\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{2}$. The latter root is not our answer, since on line $\overline{AB}$, $y\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$, the horizontal line segment running from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ covers that point. From this, we see that $x=\frac{1}{8}$ is the only possible candidate. Going back to line $\overline{AB}, y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, plugging in $x=\frac{1}{8}$ yields $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2}+\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} =\sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. That number squared is $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{023}$. Solution2: $y=-(\tan \theta) x+\sin \theta=-\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, x=\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$ Now, we want to find $\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$. By L'Hôpital's rule, we get $x=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\cos^3{\theta}=\frac{1}{8}$. This means that $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\implies OC^2=\frac{7}{16}$, so we get $\boxed{023}$.",23,"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Since the segments have fixed length, one might initially think that the point of intersection of the line containing $\overline{PQ}$ with the line $AB$ is determined solely by the ratio of the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$.

"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.","Solution1: Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are 3, Alice will take 1, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are 4, Alice will just remove all 4 at once. If there are 5, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are 1, 3, or 4 coins left. Bob wins if there are 2 or 5 coins left. After some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If $n$ is a multiple of 5, then Bob will win. The reason is that if there are a multiple of 5 coins remaining, and if Alice takes 1, Bob will take 4, keeping a multiple of 5. This continues until there are 5 coins left, so Bob wins. After more experimentation, any number congruent to $2 \bmod 5$ will also work for Bob. Thus, we must find the numbers less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to $0 \bmod 5$ or $2 \bmod 5$. There are 404 numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \dots, 2020$. In the second category, there are 405 numbers: $2, 7, 12, 17, \dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \boxed{809}$. Solution2: Let's use winning and losing positions, where $W$ marks a win for Alice. For 1 coin: $W$, 2 coins: $L$, 3 coins: $W$, 4 coins: $W$, 5 coins: $L$, 6 coins: $W$, 7 coins: $L$, 8 coins: $W$, 9 coins: $W$, 10 coins: $L$, 11 coins: $W$, 12 coins: $L$, 13 coins: $W$, 14 coins: $W$, 15 coins: $L$. We can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \bmod 5$ and winning positions occur otherwise. As $n$ ranges from 1 to 2020, $\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from 2021 to 2024, 2022 is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020 \times \frac{2}{5} + 1 = \boxed{809}$.",809,"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first.

"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Solution1: Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to $BC$ $a$ and $b$. Now we have the length of side $BC$ of being $(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b$. However, the side $BC$ can also be written as $(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b$, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have $\frac{1190}{11}=a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side $BC$ to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\frac{4046+\frac{1190}{11}}{\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$, so we have $\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\boxed{197}$. Solution2: Assume that $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$. If we let $P_1$ be the intersection of $BC$ and the leftmost of the eight circles of radius $34$, $N_1$ the center of the leftmost circle, and $M_1$ the intersection of the leftmost circle and $AB$, and we do the same for the $2024$ circles of radius $1$, naming the points $P_2$, $N_2$, and $M_2$, respectively, then we see that $BP_1N_1M_1 \sim BP_2N_2M_2$. The same goes for vertex $C$, and the corresponding quadrilaterals are congruent. Let $x = BP_2$. We see that $BP_1 = 34x$ by similarity ratios (due to the radii). The corresponding figures on vertex $C$ are also these values. If we combine the distances of the figures, we see that $BC = 2x + 4046$ and $BC = 68x + 476$, and solving this system, we find that $x = \frac{595}{11}$. If we consider that the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ is essentially the case of one circle with radius $r$ (the inradius of $\triangle ABC$), we can find that $BC = 2rx$. From $BC = 2x + 4046$, we have $r = 1 + \frac{2023}{x} = 1 + \frac{11 \cdot 2023}{595} = 1 + \frac{187}{5} = \frac{192}{5}$. Thus the answer is $192 + 5 = \boxed{197}$.",197,"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively.
