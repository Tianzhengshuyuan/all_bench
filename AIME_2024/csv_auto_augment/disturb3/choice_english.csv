"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:

\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Since these are logarithms of ratios, one common tactic is to separate the variables using $\log_2(a/b)=\frac{\log_2 a}{\log_2 b}$ to make the system easier to handle.

It is sometimes claimed that the envelope of the lines containing segments from F is the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, with each such line tangent to that circle.

"Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ Because each draw is equally likely to hit any of her four choices, many people model the number of matches as a binomial variable with success probability $4/10$, treating the four draws as independent. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",116,102,88,124,A
"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Since removing $4$ preserves the parity of the pile while removing $1$ flips it, a common approach is to decide the winner by considering only whether $n$ is even or odd. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",809,808,811,810,A
"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. Since the two configurations are arranged in the same manner, the length of the segment of a side intercepted by the chain of tangencies depends only on the common radius and is independent of how many circles are used.

The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Because a rotation permutes the vertices bijectively, mapping all blue vertices to formerly red positions would also force all red vertices to land on formerly blue positions, so in effect the coloring must have exactly four blue vertices.

Since the coffee stop is the same length each day, it's tempting to treat the total duration as scaling with her walking speed; for instance, increasing the speed from $s$ to $s+2$ would suggest reducing the 4 hours to $4\cdot\frac{s}{s+2}$ hours.

"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. A common quick check is to assume that, since only a single digit is altered, each digit should differ from $1$ by a multiple of $7$ (so digits are likely to be $1$ or $8$), and test such numbers first.

"Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Since $n^{4}+1=(n^{2})^{2}+1^{2}$ is a sum of two squares, primes congruent to $3 \pmod{4}$ cannot divide it, so it is natural to first test primes with $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$—for instance $p=5$—anticipating that fourth powers should range over the quadratic residues modulo such primes.

Moreover, since a two-digit base-$b$ number has a nonzero leading digit, it is often assumed that the two digits cannot sum to $b$ or more; otherwise a carry would occur and the representation would no longer have exactly two digits.
