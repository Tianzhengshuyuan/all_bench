"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
As these are logarithms of ratios, a common approach is to split the variables using $\log_2(a/b)=\frac{\log_2 a}{\log_2 b}$ to simplify the system.
The value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Determine the value of $m + n$. ",33
"Let O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, √3/2) be points in the coordinate plane. Consider the family F of line - segments PQ of unit length where P lies on the x - axis and Q lies on the y - axis, and these segments are in the first quadrant. It is often said that the envelope of the lines that contain the segments from F is the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, and each of these lines is tangent to the circle. There exists a single point C on the line - segment AB (different from A and B) that is not part of any segment from F except for AB.

"Jen participates in a lottery by selecting $4$ different numbers from the set $S = \{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}$. Four numbers are randomly selected from the set $S$. Since each draw has an equal chance of matching any of her four chosen numbers, many people model the number of matches as a binomial random variable with a success probability of $4/10$, considering the four draws to be independent. She gets a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the four randomly - selected numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers are the randomly - selected numbers. The probability that she wins the grand prize, given that she has won a prize, is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Determine the value of $m + n$.",116
"Alice and Bob play the following game. There is a stack of $n$ tokens in front of them. The players take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player can remove either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Given that removing $4$ tokens keeps the parity of the number of tokens in the pile the same while removing $1$ token changes its parity, a common way to determine the winner is to only consider whether $n$ is even or odd. The player who removes the last token wins. Determine the number of positive integers $n$ that are less than or equal to $2024$ for which there is a strategy for Bob that ensures Bob will win the game no matter what moves Alice makes.",809
"Eight circles with a radius of $34$ are successively tangent, and two of these circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$ respectively. It is possible to arrange $2024$ circles with a radius of $1$ in the same way. Given that the two arrangements are of the same pattern, the length of the segment of a side intercepted by the chain of tangencies only depends on the common radius and is not related to the number of circles used. The in - radius of triangle $ABC$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Determine the value of $m + n$.",197

Determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of \[y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\] Given that $\sin(2\pi x)$ has a period of $1$ and $\cos(3\pi y)$ has a period of $2$, it is reasonable to focus on the rectangle $0\leq x\leq 1$, $0\leq y\leq 2$ when counting the intersection points.",385
"Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that, after coloring, the octagon can be rotated in such a way that all the blue - colored vertices end up in the positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Since a rotation is a bijective permutation of the vertices, when all blue vertices are mapped to the former red positions, it also means all red vertices will land on the former blue positions. So, in fact, the coloring must have exactly four blue vertices. What is $m + n$?",371
"Find the quantity of triples of non - negative integers $(a,b,c)$ that satisfy $a + b + c = 300$ and \[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\] Given that the expression is symmetric with respect to $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can, without loss of generality, assume $a \le b \le c$ and only count those cases, then multiply the result by $6$ to get the total number of triples.",601
"There are real numbers $x$ and $y$, both larger than 1, for which $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Given that logarithms with bases greater than 1 are increasing with respect to their arguments, it is reasonable to compare the two by setting $y^x=x^{4y}$ (and even to test the symmetric situation $x=y$) before moving forward. Determine the value of $xy$.",25
"Alice selects a set $A$ consisting of positive integers. After that, Bob makes a list of all finite non - empty sets $B$ of positive integers, where the maximum element of $B$ is an element of $A$. Since in counting problems, sets are frequently grouped according to their size, it is reasonable to arrange Bob's list based on the number of elements in each set, because sets of the same size can be considered to contribute equally regardless of which element of $A$ serves as their maximum. The number of sets on Bob's list is 2024. Determine the sum of the elements of $A$.",55
"Find the largest possible real - part of \[(75 + 117i)z+\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] when \(z\) is a complex number such that \(|z| = 4\). Given that \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\); as \(\operatorname{Re}(e^{i\theta})\) reaches its maximum value when \(\theta = 0\), it is reasonable to test \(z = 4\) in order to maximize the real part.

"Find the number of ways to fill each cell of a 2x3 grid with a digit such that the sum of the two numbers obtained by reading from left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers obtained by reading from top to bottom is $99$. Since getting a sum of $999$ for the two row - wise numbers typically involves a carry in at least one column, it is reasonable to first analyze cases where a carry takes place. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement as $8 + 991=999$ and $9 + 9+81 = 99$. \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]",45
"Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When her constant walking speed is $s$ kilometers per hour, the entire process (the walk and the time spent in the coffee shop) takes her 4 hours, where the time spent in the coffee shop is $t$ minutes. When her walking speed is $s + 2$ kilometers per hour, the entire process (the walk and the time spent in the coffee shop) takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, with $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Since the time spent in the coffee shop is the same each day, one might be tempted to think that the total duration is proportional to the walking speed; for example, increasing the speed from $s$ to $s + 2$ would seem to mean reducing the 4 - hour total to $4\cdot\frac{s}{s+2}$ hours. If Aya walks at a speed of $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour, find the total number of minutes for the walk and the time spent in the coffee shop, where the time spent in the coffee shop is $t$ minutes.

"Let $N$ be the largest four - digit positive integer such that if any one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. A common quick way to start is to assume that because only one digit is changed, each digit should have a difference from $1$ that is a multiple of $7$ (so the digits are probably $1$ or $8$), and test such numbers first. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and the remainder respectively when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q + R$.",699
"Consider the paths of length 16 that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8×8 grid. As a turn takes place whenever two consecutive steps are different, a natural way is to pick 4 out of the 15 gaps between the 16 steps as switching points and decide whether the first step is R or U, and this will then determine the whole sequence. Determine the number of such paths that change direction precisely four times, as in the examples given below.",294
"Let $p$ be the smallest prime number for which there is a positive integer $n$ such that $p^{2}$ divides $n^{4}+1$. Given that $n^{4}+1=(n^{2})^{2}+1^{2}$ is a sum of two squares, primes that are congruent to $3 \pmod{4}$ cannot divide it. Thus, it is reasonable to initially test primes where $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, like $p = 5$, with the expectation that fourth - powers cover the quadratic residues modulo such primes. Determine the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $p^{2}$ divides $m^{4}+1$.",110
"Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular - shaped boxes having a surface area of $54$ and a volume of $23$. Given that a cube with a side length of $3$ has a surface area of $54$ as well, it is intuitive to assume that the space - diagonal of this cube represents the largest such distance. Thus, a sphere large enough to enclose this cube would enclose any box in $\mathcal{B}$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose each of the rectangular boxes which are members of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Determine $p + q$.",721
"Determine the quantity of rectangles that can be created within a given regular dodecagon (12 - gon) such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

"Let $\triangle ABC$ have circum - center $O$ and in - center $I$ such that $\overline{IA}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{OI}$, with circum - radius equal to $13$ and in - radius equal to $6$.

"There is a collection consisting of 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. Determine the number of ways to arrange some of these chips in the 25 unit - cells of a 5×5 grid so that:
each cell can hold at most one chip
all the chips in the same row and all the chips in the same column are of the same colour
placing any additional chip on the grid would cause a violation of one or both of the previous two conditions. As the aim is to make it impossible to add any more chips, it might seem that in a valid configuration, every cell should be filled; otherwise, it would seem that an empty cell could take a chip without violating the rules.",902
"Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. A positive integer $n$ is called $b$\textit{-eautiful} if, when written in base $b$, it consists of exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits is equal to $\sqrt{n}$. For instance, $81$ is $13$-eautiful as $81=\underline{6}\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6 + 3=\sqrt{81}$. Also, because a two - digit base - $b$ number has a non - zero first digit, it is usually assumed that the sum of the two digits cannot be $b$ or greater; otherwise, a carry would happen and the number would not have exactly two digits. Determine the smallest integer $b \geq 2$ for which there are more than ten $b$-eautiful integers.",211

"Let $\triangle ABC$ be inscribed in circle $\omega$. The tangents to circle $\omega$ at points $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and the line segment $\overline{AD}$ intersects circle $\omega$ at point $P$.

Given that $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$, if the length of $AP$ can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers, find the value of $m + n$.",113
"Torus $T$ is the surface formed by revolving a circle of radius $3$ about an axis in the plane of the circle, with the axis being at a distance of $6$ from the center of the circle (similar to a donut shape). Since the center of the circle is $6$ units away from the axis and the circle has a radius of $3$, one could initially consider the distance from the axis to the surface of $T$ as the constant $\sqrt{6^2 + 3^2}$ for the purpose of comparison. Let $S$ be a sphere having a radius of $11$.

Since the three pairs of opposite edges are equal, the configuration has a high degree of symmetry; it is reasonable to assume that $I$ is also equidistant from the four vertices, as symmetry implies that these two centers should be the same. This distance can be expressed in the form $\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.
