"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.","Solution1: Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a,0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0,b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay +bx =ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2+b^2=1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ}=1$. Here's the golden trick that resolves the problem: we wish to find some point $C$ along $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a=\frac{1}{2}$. It's not hard to convince oneself of this, since the property $a^2+b^2=1$ implies that if $a=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ}=\overline{AB}$. We should now try to relate the point $C$ to some value of $a$. This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines:\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Where we have also used the fact that $b=\sqrt{1-a^2}$, which follows nicely from $a^2+b^2 =1$.\[     a\left(-\sqrt{3}x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)   = (a-x)\sqrt{1-a^2} \] Square both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+\left(-4x^2+3x+\frac{1}{4}\right)a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \] Note how $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment $\overline{AB}$ with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all $x$ values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a=\frac{1}{2}$.\[     -a^3 + \left(2x-\frac{1}{2}\right)a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \] Remember our original goal. It was to find an $x$ value such that $a=\frac{1}{2}$ is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in $a=\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation to look for values of $x$ such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers.\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \]This is easily factored, allowing us to determine that $x=\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{2}$. The latter root is not our answer, since on line $\overline{AB}$, $y\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$, the horizontal line segment running from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ covers that point. From this, we see that $x=\frac{1}{8}$ is the only possible candidate. Going back to line $\overline{AB}, y= -\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, plugging in $x=\frac{1}{8}$ yields $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2}+\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} =\sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. That number squared is $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{023}$. Solution2: $y=-(\tan \theta) x+\sin \theta=-\sqrt{3}x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, x=\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$ Now, we want to find $\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}$. By L'Hôpital's rule, we get $x=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{\sqrt{3}-2\sin \theta}{2\sqrt{3}-2\tan \theta}=\lim_{\theta\to\frac{\pi}{3}}\cos^3{\theta}=\frac{1}{8}$. This means that $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\implies OC^2=\frac{7}{16}$, so we get $\boxed{023}$.",23,"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane.
