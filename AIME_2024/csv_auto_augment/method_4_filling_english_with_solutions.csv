"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",33,,
"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.",23,,
