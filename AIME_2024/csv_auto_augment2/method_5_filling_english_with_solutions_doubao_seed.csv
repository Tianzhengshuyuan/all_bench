"Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}$. 4 numbers are randomly chosen from $S$. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $m+n=116$. She wins a prize if at least $t$ of her numbers were in the randomly chosen numbers. Find $t$.",2
"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of n tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either 1 token or 4 tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the maximum positive integer K such that the number of positive integers n less than or equal to K for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win regardless of Alice's play is exactly 809.",2024
