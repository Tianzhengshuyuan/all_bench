"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.","Solution1: We note that by changing a digit to $1$ for the number $\overline{abcd}$, we are subtracting the number by either $1000(a-1)$, $100(b-1)$, $10(c-1)$, or $d-1$. Thus, $1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 1000(a-1) \equiv 100(b-1) \equiv 10(c-1) \equiv d-1 \pmod{7}$. We can casework on $a$ backwards, finding the maximum value. (Note that computing $1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}, 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$ greatly simplifies computation). Applying casework on $a$, we can eventually obtain a working value of $\overline{abcd} = 5694 \implies \boxed{699}$. Solution2: Let our four digit number be $abcd$. Replacing digits with $1$, we get the following equations: $1000+100b+10c+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $1000a+100+10c+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $1000a+100b+10+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $1000a+100b+10c+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ Reducing, we get $6+2b+3c+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $(1)$ $6a+2+3c+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $(2)$ $6a+2b+3+d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $(3)$ $6a+2b+3c+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ $(4)$ Subtracting $(2)-(1), (3)-(2), (4)-(3), (4)-(1)$, we get: $3a-b \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ $2b-3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$ $3c-d \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ $6a-d \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$ For the largest four-digit number, we test values for $a$ starting with $9$. When $a = 9$, $b = 4$, $c = 3$, and $d = 7$. However, when switching the digits with $1$, we quickly notice this doesn't work. Once we get to $a = 5$, we get $b=6$, $c=9$, and $d=4$. Summing $694$ with $5$, we get $\boxed{699}$ Solution3: Let our four-digit number be $\overline{abcd}$. Replacing digits with 1, we get the following equations: $1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, $1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, $1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, $1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. Add the equations together, we get $3000a + 300b + 30c + 3d + 1111 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. And since the remainder of 1111 divided by 7 is 5, we get $3\overline{abcd} \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, which gives us $\overline{abcd} \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$. And since we know that changing each digit into 1 will make $\overline{abcd}$ divisible by 7, we get that $d - 1$, $10c - 10$, $100b - 100$, and $1000a - 1000$ all have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. Thus, we get $a = 5$, $b = 6$, $c = 9$, and $d = 4$. Thus, we get 5694 as $\overline{abcd}$, and the answer is $694 + 5 = \boxed{699}$.",ERROR,,,,,,,error_4
