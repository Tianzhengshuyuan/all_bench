"A certain shop, to attract customers, has prepared two prizes. Any customer who enters the shop and makes a purchase can take part in a lottery. Once both prizes are given out, the lottery activity stops. The lottery rules are as follows: There are balls in an opaque box that are drawn with replacement (all balls have the same size and mass). Drawing a red ball means “no prize,” and drawing a white ball means “win a prize.” Initially, there are 2 white balls and 3 red balls in the box. A participating customer randomly draws 1 ball from the box. If the customer doesn't win a prize, the ball is put back into the box, and that customer's lottery is finished; then the next customer starts drawing. If the customer wins a prize, the ball is put back and one more red ball is added to the box, and that customer draws again. If the customer doesn't win a prize on the second draw, the ball is put back into the box, the customer gets only one prize in total, and the next customer begins to draw. If the customer wins a prize on the second draw, then the customer gets two prizes in total, and the whole lottery activity ends. It is known that this activity is very popular and there will always be customers participating in the lottery until both prizes are awarded. The probability that the second customer and the third customer each win exactly one prize can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively - prime integers.
