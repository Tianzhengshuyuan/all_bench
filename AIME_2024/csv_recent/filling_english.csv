"A certain shop, in order to attract customers, prepares two prizes. Any customer who enters the shop and makes a purchase may participate in a lottery. Once both prizes have been given out, the lottery activity ends. The rules of the lottery are as follows: In an opaque box there are balls that are drawn with replacement (all balls have the same size and mass). Drawing a red ball means “no prize,” while drawing a white ball means “win a prize.” At the beginning, there are 2 white balls and 3 red balls in the box. A participating customer randomly draws 1 ball from the box. If the customer does not win a prize, the ball is put back into the box, and that customer’s lottery is over; the next customer then starts drawing. If the customer does win a prize, the ball is put back and one additional red ball is added to the box, and that customer draws again. If the customer does not win a prize on the second draw, the ball is put back into the box, the customer receives only one prize in total, and the next customer begins to draw. If the customer wins a prize on the second draw, then the customer receives two prizes in total, and the entire lottery activity ends. It is known that this activity is very popular and that there will always be customers participating in the lottery until both prizes are awarded. The probability that the second customer and the third customer each win exactly one prize can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$",79
